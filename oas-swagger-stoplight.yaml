        ## Create an Adjustment via API

        Creating an adjustment requires a valid, live subscription. The subscription must be referenced by `id`. For more information on creating a subscription, please see our [subscriptions introduction.](#docTextSection:aDNGencbmFC7h2NEW)

        In order to create an adjustment, pass an amount and an optional memo. The amount can be specified by either the `amount` parameter or the `amount_in_cents` parameter. The amount can be specified as a positive or a negative number. 

        Optionally, the `adjustment_method` parameter can be specified.

        ## Create an Adjustment via UI

        For more information on how to record an adjustment via the UI, please see our documentation [here.](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/adjustments.html#how-to-record-an-adjustment)

        ## Scenarios for adjustments

        | Scenario 1 | To create an Adjustment on a Subscription to increase the balance by a certain dollar amount, include the following to your request: | `"amount":"4.00"`                                            |
        |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Scenario 2 | To increase the Subscription balance by a certain amount of cents, use the following attribute in your request:                      | `"amount_in_cents":100`                                      |
        | Scenario 3 | To decrease the Subscription balance by a certain dollar amount, the request must contain:                                           | `"amount":"-4.00"`                                           |
        | Scenario 4 | To decrease the Subscription balance by a certain amount of cents, use:                                                              | `"amount_in_cents":"-400"`                                   |
        | Scenario 5 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact dollar amount, include the following attributes to the request:                          | `"adjustment_method":"target", "amount":"100.00"`            |
        | Scenario 6 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact positive amount of cents, the request must contain the following attributes:             | `"adjustment_method":"target",` `"amount_in_cents":"10000"`  |
        | Scenario 7 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact negative amount of cents, use the following attributes in the request:                   | `"adjustment_method":"target",` `"amount_in_cents":"-10000"` |

      description: "## Create Allocation for On/Off Component\n\nAfter a subscription has been created, you may enable of disable the on/off componentat any time. To do this, use the [Allocations](#endpoint:3stsG5oibfdivng9j) endpoint.\n\nThe method creates a new allocation, setting the current allocated quantity for the Component and recording a memo.\n\n**Notice**: Allocations can only be updated for Quantity and On/Off Components.\n\n## Proration Schemes\n\nChanging the allocated quantity of a component mid-period can result in either a Charge or Credit being applied to the subscription. When creating an allocation via the API, you can pass the `upgrade_charge`, `downgrade_credit`, and `accrue_charge` to be applied.\n\nFor background information on prorated components and upgrade/downgrade schemes, see: API: [Setting Component Allocations.](<https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html>) See the tables below for valid values.\n\n| upgrade_charge | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `full` \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_A charge is added for the full price of the component. \_\_\_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n| `prorated` \_ \_ |\_A charge is added for the prorated price of the component change. |\n| `none` \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_No charge is added. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\n\n| downgrade_credit | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `full` \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_A full price credit is added for the amount owed. |\n| `prorated` \_ \_ \_ |\_A prorated credit is added for the amount owed. \_ |\n| `none` \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_No charge is added. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\n\n| accrue_charge | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_   |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `true` \_ \_ \_ \_| Attempt to charge the customer at next renewal.                                                            |\n| `false` \_ \_ \_ |\_Attempt to charge the customer right away.\_If it fails, the charge will be accrued until the next renewal. |\n\n### Order of Resolution for upgrade_charge and downgrade_credit\n\n1. Per allocation in API call (within a single allocation of the `allocations` array)\n2. [Component-level default value](<https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html#component-proration>)\n3. Allocation API call top level (outside of the `allocations` array)\n4.

By default, this is an integer.|\n| memo                       | (optional) A memo to record along with the allocation |\n| upgrade_charge             | (optional) The type of charge to be created if the change in cost is an upgrade. Defaults to the component and then site setting if one is not provided. |\n| downgrade_credit           | (optional) The type of credit to be created if the change in cost is a downgrade. Defaults to the component and then site setting if one is not provided. |\n| accrue_charge              | (optional) If the change in cost is an upgrade, this determines if the charge should accrue to the next renewal or if capture should be attempted immediately. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |\n| proration_upgrade_scheme   | (deprecated) The scheme used if the proration is an upgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |\n| proration_downgrade_scheme | (deprecated) The scheme used if the proration is a downgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |\n| payment_collection_method  | (optional, default `automatic`) For subscriptions on invoice billing, when `proration_upgrade_scheme` is set to either `prorate-attempt-capture` or `full-price-attempt-capture` and `payment_collection_method` is set to invoice, a mid-period invoice will be created from any charges that are a result of the allocation change. The charge will not appear on the invoice created at the next renewal.

        ### Simplified example using component_id as integer

        ```
        curl mysub.chargify.com/product_families/999/components/999
        ```

        both examples assume component with id 999 has handle 'foo'

        ## Create Component within a Product Family

        This request will create a component under the specified product family. Please note that you may not edit components via API. To do so, please log into the application.

        ### Component Documentation

        For more information on components, please see our documentation [here.](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html)

        ## Plural Kind  

        In order to create a component via API, a `plural_kind` is required. Plural kind is defined as the endpoint for the type of component you wish to create.

        Use one of the following:

        + metered_components
        + quantity_based_components
        + on_off_components

        ## Metered Component Example

      description: |-
        ## Create Usage for Subscription

        This endpoint allows you to record an instance of metered usage for a subscription. The `quantity` from usage for each component is accumulated to the `unit_balance` on the [Component Line Item](https://reference.chargify.com/v1/component-line-items/component-line-items) for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered components, Chargify gives you the option to specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        If an invalid `price_point_id` is submitted, the endpoint will return an error. 

        ## Deducting Usage

        In the event that you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you may provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded:

        ```{
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        At this point, `unit_balance` would be `5000`. To reduce the balance to `0`, POST the following payload:

        ```{
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        The `unit_balance` has a floor of `0`; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be `0`, not `-100`.

        ## Read Usage by Component

        This request will return a list of the usages associated with a subscription for a particular metered component. This will display the previously recorded components for a subscription.

        This endpoint is not compatible with quantity-based components.

        ## Since Date and Until Date Usage 

        Note: The `since_date` and `until_date` attributes each default to midnight on the date specified. For example, in order to list usages for January 20th, you would need to append the following to the URL. 

        ```
        ?since_date=2016-01-20&until_date=2016-01-21
        ```

        ## Read Usage by Handle

        Use this endpoint to read the previously recorded components for a subscription.  You can now specify either the component id (integer) or the component handle prefixed by "handle:" to specify the unique identifier for the component you are working with.

        ## Create Multiple Allocations

        Creates multiple allocations, setting the current allocated quantity for each of the components and recording a memo. The charges and/or credits that are created will be rolled up into a single total which is used to determine whether this is an upgrade or a downgrade. Be aware of the Order of Resolutions explained below in determining the proration scheme.

        This endpoint only responds to JSON. It is not available for XML.

        When updating a price point, it's prices can be updated as well by creating new prices or editing / removing existing ones.

        Passing in a price bracket without an `id` will attempt to create a new price. 

        Including an `id` will update the corresponding price, and including the `_destroy` flag set to true along with the `id` will remove that price.

        ## Bulk Update a Subscription's Component's Price Points

        Updates the price points on one or more of a subscription's components.

        The `price_point` key can take either a:
        1. Price point id (integer)
        2. Price point handle (string)
        3. `"_default"` string, which will reset the price point to the component's current default price point.

        ## Read a Coupon

        You can retrieve the Coupon via the API with the Show method. You must identify the Coupon in this call by the ID parameter that Chargify assigns.
        If instead you would like to find a Coupon using a Coupon code, see the Coupon Find method.

        ## Update a Coupon

        You can update a Coupon via the API with a PUT request to the resource endpoint.

        You can restrict a coupon to only apply to specific products / components by optionally passing in hashes of `restricted_products` and/or `restricted_components` in the format:
        `{ "<product/component_id>": boolean_value }`

        ## Archive a Coupon

        You can archive a Coupon via the API with the archive method.
        Archiving makes that Coupon unavailable for future use, but allows it to remain attached and functional on existing Subscriptions that are using it.
        The `archived_at` date and time will be assigned.

        ## Finding a Coupon

        You can search for a coupon via the API with the find method. By passing a code parameter, the find will attempt to locate a coupon that matches that code. If no coupon is found, a 404 is returned.

        If you have more than one product family and if the coupon you are trying to find does not belong to the first product family in your site, then you will need to specify (either in the url or as a query string param) the product family id.

        You can retrieve a coupon via the API with the show method. You must identify the coupon in this call by the id parameter that Chargify assigns. If instead you would like to find a coupon using a coupon code, see the Coupon Find method.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/product_families/<product_family_id>/coupons/find.<format>?code=<coupon_code>
        ```

        **OR**

        ```

        ```

        ## Validate a Coupon

        You can verify if a specific coupon code is valid using the `validate` method. This method is useful for validating coupon codes that are entered by a customer. If the coupon is found and is valid, the coupon will be returned with a 200 status code.

        If the coupon is invalid, the status code will be 404 and the response will say why it is invalid. If the coupon is valid, the status code will be 200 and the coupon will be returned. The following reasons for invalidity are supported:

        + Coupon not found
        + Coupon is invalid
        + Coupon expired

        If you have more than one product family and if the coupon you are validating does not belong to the first product family in your site, then you will need to specify (either in the url or as a query string param) the product family id.

        Eg.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/product_families/<product_family_id>/coupons/validate.<format>?code=<coupon_code>
        ```

        Or:

        ```

        ## Delete the Coupon Subcode

        If the Coupon subcode is successfully removed, a "200" response code will be returned. Otherwise, a "404" error will be returned.

        ## Example

        Given a coupon with an ID of 567, and a coupon subcode of 20OFF, the URL to `DELETE` this coupon subcode would be: 

        ```
        http://subdomain.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20OFF.<format>
        ```

        Note: If you are using any of the allowed special characters (“%”, “@”, “+”, “-”, “_”, and “.”), you must encode them for use in the URL.

        | Special character | Encoding |

        | %                 | %25      |

        ## Create Metafields

        Use the following method to create metafields for your Site. Metafields can be populated with metadata after the fact.

        ## Create Multiple Metafields 

        In order to create multiple metafields in one request, use the following JSON format:

        ```
        {
            "metafields": [
              {"name": "Color"},
              {"name": "Brand"}
            ]
          }
        ```

        ## Create a Dropdown Metafield

        The default `input_type` for a custom field is `text`. Here's an example request that creates a metafield with `dropdown` options defined in an `enum` array:

        ```
        {
          "metafields": {
            "name": "Dropdown field",
            "input_type": "dropdown",
            "enum": [

        ## Delete Metafields

        Use the following method to delete a metafield. This will remove the metafield from the Site. 

        Additionally, this will remove the metafield and associated metadata with all Subscriptions on the Site.

        ## Server Response

        The server will response with code `200` for successful, and `404` for unsuccessful.

        ## Example

        If you wanted to delete the metafield for customers named strength you would request:

        ```https://my-subdomain.chargify.com/customers/metafields.json?name=strength```

        ## Create a Customer

        You can create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one Customer for a given `reference` value. If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the Customer from your own app, i.e. the Customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given Customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the Customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

        Only those attributes not marked as "read only" may be set via POST (create) or PUT (update) operations.

        ## Required Country Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard Country codes when formatting country attribute of the customer.

        Countries should be formatted as 2 characters. For more information, please see the following wikipedia article on [ISO_3166-1.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes)

        ## Required State Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard State codes when formatting state attribute of the customer.

        + US States (2 characters): [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US)

        + States Outside the US (2-3 characters): To find the correct state codes outside of the US, please go to [ISO_3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) and click on the link in the “ISO 3166-2 codes” column next to country you wish to populate.

        This relates to refunding a consolidated invoice (see above for docs on refunding a non-consolidated or segment invoice). This endpoint accepts a `memo`, `payment_id`, and array of `segment_uids`, which are the segments of the consolidated invoice that you would like to be refunded or `segment_uids: 'all'` to indicate that the entire invoice should be refunded.

        **Each segment that is passed in will be refunded in full**. If you need to partially refund a segment, do each segment individually by following the above docs for refunding a single invoice.

        ## Read Invoice Events

        This endpoint returns a list of invoice events. Each event contains event "data" (such as an applied payment) as well as a snapshot of the `invoice` at the time of event completion.

        Exposed event types are:

        + issue_invoice 
        + apply_credit_note
        + apply_payment
        + refund_invoice
        + void_invoice
        + void_remainder
        + backport_invoice
        + change_invoice_status

        Invoice events are returned in ascending order.

        If both a `since_date` and `since_id` are provided in request parameters, the `since_date` will be used.

        Note - invoice events that occurred prior to 09/05/2018 __will not__ contain an `invoice` snapshot.
      parameters:
        - name: invoice_uid

        ## Create Payment
        This API call should be used when you want to record an external payment against a specific invoice. If you would like to apply a payment across multiple invoices, you can use the [bulk payment](#endpoint:EMs2kYgYbkxKtnpij) endpoint.

        ## Create a Payment from the Subscription's Prepayment Account

        In order apply a prepayment to an invoice, specify the `type` as `prepayment`, and also the `amount`.


        ```
        {
          "type": "prepayment",
          "payment": {
            "amount": 10.00,
          }
        }
        ```

        Note that the `amount` must be less than or equal to the Subscription's Prepayment account balance.

        ## Create a Payment from the Subscription's Service Credit Account

        In order to apply a service credit to an invoice, specify the `type` as `service_credit`:


        ```
        {
          "type": "service_credit",
        }
        ```

        Note that Chargify will attempt to fully pay the invoice's `due_amount` from the Subscription's Service Credit account. At this time you cannot partially pay an invoice from a Subscription's Service Credit account. Therefore, the Service Credit account balance must be greater than or equal to the invoice's `due_amount`.

        Credit Notes are like inverse invoices. They reduce the amount a customer owes.

        By default, the credit notes returned by this endpoint will exclude the arrays of `line_items`, `discounts`, `taxes`, `applications`, or `refunds`. To include these arrays, pass the specific field as a key in the query with a value set to `true`.

        ### Overview

        This endpoint allows you to reopen any invoice with the "canceled" status. Invoices enter "canceled" status if they were open at the time the subscription was canceled (whether through dunning or an intentional cancellation).

        Invoices with "canceled" status are no longer considered to be due. Once reopened, they are considered due for payment. Payment may then be captured in one of the following ways:

        - Reactivating the subscription, which will capture all open invoices (See note below about automatic reopening of invoices.)
        - Recording a payment directly against the invoice

        A note about reactivations: any canceled invoices from the most recent active period are automatically opened as a part of the reactivation process. Reactivating via this endpoint prior to reactivation is only necessary when you wish to capture older invoices from previous periods during the reactivation.

        ### Restrictions

        Only invoices that have "canceled" status may be reopened. If the invoice identified by `{uid}` is not canceled, the response will have HTTP status code `422` and an error message.

        ### Overview

        This endpoint allows you to void any invoice with the "open" or "canceled" status.  It will also allow voiding of an invoice with the "pending" status if it is not a consolidated invoice.

        ### Restrictions

        Only invoices that have the appropriate status may be reopened. If the invoice identified by `{uid}` does not have the appropriate status, the response will have HTTP status code `422` and an error message.

        A reason for the void operation is required to be included in the request body.  If one is not provided, the response will have HTTP status code `422` and an error message.

        ## Create Offer

        Create an offer within your Chargify site by sending a POST request.

        ### Using a Product Price Point
        You can optionally pass in a `product_price_point_id` that corresponds with the `product_id` and the offer will use that price point. If a `product_price_point_id` is not passed in, the product's default price point will be used.

        The following table depicts what are the elements that are used when creating GoCardless Payment Profiles. Please note these key/value pairs do closely resemble ACH elements. However, we've created this endpoint to focus on how to formulate a request for creating a GoCardless payment profile. 

        | bank_name           | (Required when creating a subscription with ACH or GoCardless). The name of the bank where the customerʼs account resides                                                                      |
        |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | bank_iban           | (Optional when creating a subscription with GoCardless). International Bank Account Number. Alternatively, local bank details can be provided                                                  |
        | bank_routing_number | (Required when creating a subscription with ACH. Optional when creating a subscription with GoCardless). The routing number of the bank. It becomes bank_code while passing via GoCardless API |
        | bank_account_number | (Required when creating a subscription with ACH. Required when creating a subscription with GoCardless and bank_iban is blank) The customerʼs bank account number                              |
        | bank_branch_code    | (Optional when creating a subscription with GoCardless) Branch code. Alternatively, an IBAN can be provided                                                                                    |

        Augment an existing `payment_profile_id` by using this endpoint and method.

        ## Partial Card Updates

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net or Stripe payment gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload. 

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",
            "billing_address": "789 Juniper Court",
            "billing_city": "Boulder",
            "billing_state": "CO",
            "billing_zip": "80302",
            "billing_country": "US",
            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }
        ```

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card number data. 

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net** or **Stripe** as their payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net** or **Stripe**, Chargify will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account attributes (like `bank_account_number`), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due subscription after a partial update.

        This will delete a payment profile belonging to the Customer on the Subscription.

        **Note**: If the Customer has multiple Subscriptions, the payment profile will be removed from all of them.

        **Note**: Please note that if you delete the _default_ payment profile for a subscription, you will need to "specify another payment profile to be the default":#change-default-payment-profile through the api, or either prompt the user to enter a card in the billing portal or on the self-service page, or visit the Payment Details tab on the subscription in the Admin UI and use the "Add New Credit Card" or "Make Active Payment Method" link, (depending on whether there are other cards present).

        Response will be 204 / No content.

        ## Pagination and Filtering

        Using pagination The results can be filtered by date or number.  Traversal is possible using the number filters.

        ## Traversal/Pagination

        Pagination is achieved through the use of the `before_number` or `after_number` filters.  By default, the records are returned in descending `number` order, i.e. newest receipts first.  With each response, a `next` link is provided when there are more results.

        ### Example

        Consider a Site with 1000 Sales, numbered 1 through 1000.

        #### First Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales?before_number=981"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 1000,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1000, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 981, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Next Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales?before_number=981
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales?before_number=981",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales?before_number=961"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 980,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 980, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 961, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Last Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales?before_number=21
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales?before_number=21",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 20,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 20, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 1, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Subsequent Fetches

        Now that we have ingested "all" of the Sales for the Site, and we have recorded that our highest `number` was 1000, we can periodically poll to get the new Sales, always using our new highest number processed:

        ```
        GET /sales?after_number=1000
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales?after_number=1000",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 3,
            "count": 3
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1003, ...},
            { number: 1002, ...},
            { number: 1001, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        ## Pagination and Filtering

        Using pagination The results can be filtered by date or number.  Traversal is possible using the number filters.

        ## Traversal/Pagination

        Pagination is achieved through the use of the `before_number` or `after_number` filters.  By default, the records are returned in descending `number` order, i.e. newest receipts first.  With each response, a `next` link is provided when there are more results.

        ### Example

        Consider a Site with 1000 Sales Receipts, numbered 1 through 1000.

        #### First Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=981"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 1000,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1000, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 981, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Next Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?before_number=981
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=981",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=961"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 980,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 980, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 961, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Last Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?before_number=21
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=21",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 20,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 20, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 1, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Subsequent Fetches

        Now that we have ingested "all" of the Sales Receipts for the Site, and we have recorded that our highest `number` was 1000, we can periodically poll to get the new Receipts, always using our new highest number processed:

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?after_number=1000
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?after_number=1000",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 3,
            "count": 3
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1003, ...},
            { number: 1002, ...},
            { number: 1001, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        ## Read Statement IDs for a Subscription

        This method will return a list of Statement IDs associated with one subscription. Use the IDs returned here in conjunction with [Read/Show by Chargify ID](#endpoint:nyiRmzkvKSQNGa6Ag).
         
        ## Sorting examples

        Say you would like to get the 10 most recently created statements. You would specify the following optional parameters:

        + sort as `created_at`
        + direction as `desc`
        + limit your `per_page` to `10.

        If you on the other hand wish to find the oldest closed statements you could do:

        + sort as `closed_at`
        + direction as `asc`
      parameters:
        - name: page
          in: query
          description: 'Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The `page` parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to consume the results. You do this by passing in a `page` parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding `?page=2` to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be returned.'
          type: number
        - name: sort
          in: query
          description: 'Possible values: `created_at`, `opened_at`, or `closed_at`. This allows you to choose what you would like to sort on. (Defaults to `created_at`).'
          type: string
        - name: direction
          in: query
          description: |+

            This parameter specifies the sorting order and only works if a `sort` value is also passed. With `asc` and `desc` values, you can choose whether the items are to be sorted in ascending or descending order. Default value is `asc`.

          type: string
          enum:
            - 'Default:`asc`'

        ## List Statements for a Site

        This method will return a paginated list of all Statements generated by the Subscriptions in your Site.

        Note that this endpoint returns a "lighter" set of the Statement attributes than the "List Statements for a Subscription" endpoint.  This endpoint omits the HTML and textual representations for the Statement: `basic_html_view`, `html_view`, and `text_view`.  If you require these attributes, you can either build them yourself based on the other data returned or fetch a single subscription via the "Read/Show by Chargify ID" endpoint.

        ## Update Subscription: Product Change

        This method changes the product and/or the price point, and the new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. If you desire prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the docs on upgrades/downgrades and the [migrations API](#docTextSection:HRFQ33cF69MpBa5dE).

        To perform a product change, simply set the `product_handle` attribute with the `handle` of a different product from the same site as the subscription. Note that no proration or period reset is initiated when you change the product using this method.

        You can also change the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle`

        ## Use of Product ID 

        You may use the `product_id` and the corresponding integer associated with the `product_id` to update the subscription.

        ```
        {

        ## Create a charge

        Creating a charge requires a valid, live subscription. The subscription must be referenced by `subscription_id` (available via the API when subscriptions are read or listed – more).

        A payment in the amount of the assessed charge is automatically captured from the credit card on file for the subscription.

        This endpoint is only available for Statement-based sites.  It is not available for sites using Relationship Invoicing.

        ## Limitations of attribute combinations

        When you add a charge to an existing subscription, you may only use the following combinations of attributes:

        + `delay_capture` = true

        OR

        + `delay_capture` = false
        + `accrue_on_failure` = false

        OR

        + `delay_capture` = false
        + `accrue_on_failure` = true

        You may not use the following combination of attributes:

        + `delay_capture` = true
        + `accrue_on_failure` = true

        ## Add Subscription to Group

        For sites making use of the [Relationship Billing](https://help.chargify.com/invoices/index.html) and [Customer Hierarchy](https://help.chargify.com/relationship-invoicing/customer-hierarchies-whopays.html) features, it is possible to add existing subscriptions to subscription groups.

        Passing `group` parameters with a `target` containing a `type` and optional `id` is all that's needed. When the `target` parameter specifies a `"customer"` or `"subscription"` that is already part of a hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group.  If the target customer or subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value of 
        * `"self"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing customer,
        * `"parent"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a customer hierarchy, or
        * `"eldest"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing customer's hierarchy.  

        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy.  When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy also.

        ### Group Attributes 

        | target  | Attributes of the target customer who will be the responsible payer of the created subscription.  Required. |
        |---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | billing | Optional attributes related to billing date and accrual.                                                    |

        #### Group Target Attributes
        | type | The type of object indicated by the `id` attribute.  Only `"customer"`, `"subscription"`, `"self"`, `"parent"`, or `"eldest"` are accepted for adding a subscription to a subscription group. Required. |
        |------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | id   | The id of the target customer or subscription to group the existing subscription with.  Ignored and should not be included if type is `"self"` , `"parent"`, or `"eldest"`                              |

        #### Group Billing Attributes
        | accrue     | (Optional, default false) A flag indicating whether or not to accrue charges on the new subscription.                                                                                                                                                            |
        |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | align_date | (Optional, default false) A flag indicating whether or not to align the billing date of the new subscription with the billing date of the primary subscription of the hierarchy's default subscription group. Required to be `true` if `prorate` is also `true`. |
        | prorate    | (Optional, default false) A flag indicating whether or not to prorate billing of the new subscription for the current period. A value of `true` is ignored unless `align_date` is also `true`.                                                                   |

        Resume a paused (on-hold) subscription.  If the normal next renewal date has not passed, the subscription will return to active and will renew on that date.  Otherwise, it will behave like a reactivation, setting the billing date to 'now' and charging the subscriber.

        ## Pause Subscription

        This will place the subscription in the on_hold state and it will not renew.

        ## Limitations

        You may not place a subscription on hold if the `next_billing` date is within 24 hours.

        To update a subscription's resume date, use this method to change or update the `automatically_resume_at` date.

        ### Remove the resume date

        Alternately, you can change the `automatically_resume_at` to `null` if you would like the subscription to not have a resume date.

        ## Reset a Subscription Balance

        Chargify offers the ability to easily reset the balance of a Subscription to zero.

        If a Subscription has a positive balance, this API call will issue a credit to the Subscription for the outstanding balance.

        This is particularly helpful if you want to reactivate a canceled Subscription without charging the Customer for their previously owed balance.

        ## Past Due & Unpaid Subscriptions

        If you have a subscription that is in the `past_due` or `unpaid` state, when you reset the balance, the subscription will transition to `active`.

        ## Create Subscription Preview with Price Points

        This example **does not** use contact information to create a subscription preview. It's optional, bear in mind!

        If you do not use a `price_point_id` then the default price point will be used to calculate the preview amounts.

        ## Create Migration

        In order to create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object when you send a POST request. You may also pass either a `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` to choose which price point the subscription is moved to. If no price point identifier is passed the subscription will be moved to the products default price point. The response will be the updated subscription.

        ## Valid Subscriptions

        Subscriptions should be in the `active` or `trialing` state in order to be migrated.

        (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the `trial_ended` state via the API, however this is not recommended.  Since `trial_ended` is an end-of-life state, the subscription should be canceled, the product changed, and then the subscription can be reactivated.)

        ## Subscriptions Override Responses

        ### Successful – 204 No Content

        On a successful update, a `204` HTTP response is sent along with no body. You can assume the update was successful, and fetch the subscription again if needed.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Connection: keep-alive
        Date: Tue, 03 Nov 2015 21:40:48 GMT
        Status: 204 No Content
        ```

        ### Invalid Current Period Starts At - 422 Unprocessable Entity

        When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are made: 

        1) The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices).
        2) The value passed must be a valid date/time.
        3) The value passed must be before the current date/time.

        If you don't meet the above requirements, you will receive a 422 response and can run into the following errors:

        ```
        "error":"Current period starts at: can only be updated if subscription has no statements or invoices"
        "error":"Current period starts at: must be a valid date/time"
        "error":"Current period starts at: must be before current date and time"
        ```


        ### Unpermitted Parameters – 400 Bad Request

        If unpermitted parameters are sent, a `400` HTTP response is sent along with a string giving the reason for the problem, e.g.

        ```
        Unpermitted paramters in request: created_at
        ```

        Note: this will be changing to a JSON or XML response in the near future.

        ## Issue Service Credit

        Credit can be issued for a subscription identified by the `subscription_id`.  Credit will be added to the subscription in the amount specified in the request body.  The credit is subsequently applied to the next generated invoice.

        A successful POST will respond with 201 HTTP status and an empty response body.

        ## Read Transactions for a Site

        This method will return the full list of transactions for a Site. Pay close attention to filters and pagination in order to control results.

        **Notes about ID/Date Filters**

        - Using `since_id` and/or `max_id` is known as creating an “ID Filter”.

        - Using `since_date` and/or `until_date` is known as creating a “Date Filter”.

        - You may ONLY make use of either an ID Filter or a Date Filter in any one request.

        - If you specify both an ID Filter and a Date Filter, the Date Filter will be ignored.

        **Pagination Notes**

        Stepping through pages of results by incrementing the page number is typically less performant than using an ID Filter with `since_id`, especially at high values of page.
        For example, instead of these successive requests to traverse pagination:

            GET /transactions.json?page=1&per_page=200
            GET /transactions.json?page=2&per_page=200

        It is usually faster to use `since_id` to continue fetching from the last ID you observed:

            GET /transactions.json?since_id=0&per_page=200&direction=asc
            GET /transactions.json?since_id=1567&per_page=200&direction=asc

        In the above example, 1567 is derived by adding 1 to the “last” ID you received from the first request.

        ## Replay Webhooks for Site

        Posting to the replay endpoint does not immediate resend the webhooks. They are added to the background job queue and should be resent momentarily.

        You'll submit an array of webhook IDs to replay in the request.

        ## Update an Endpoint

        You can update an Endpoint via the API with a PUT request to the resource endpoint.

        You can change the `url` of your endpoint which consumes webhooks or list of `webhook_subscriptions`.   
        Check available [Event keys](https://help.chargify.com/webhooks/webhooks-reference.html).

        Always send a complete list of events which you want subscribe/watch.
        Sending an PUT request for existing endpoint with empty list of `webhook_subscriptions` will end with unsubscribe from all events.

        If you want unsubscribe from specific event jest send a list of `webhook_subscriptions` without the specific event key.

                Detailed description for the charge or item represented by this line.  May include proration details in plain text.

                Note: this string may contain line breaks that are hints for the best display format on the invoice.
            quantity:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The quantity or count of units billed by the line item.

                This is a decimal number represented as a string. (See "About Decimal Numbers".)
            unit_price:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The price per unit for the line item.

                When tiered pricing was used (i.e. not every unit was actually priced at the same price) this will be the blended average cost per unit and the `tiered_unit_price` field will be set to `true`.
            subtotal_amount:
              type: string
              description: 'The line subtotal, generally calculated as `quantity * unit_price`. This is the canonical amount of record for the line - when rounding differences are in play, `subtotal_amount` takes precedence over the value derived from `quantity * unit_price` (which may not have the proper precision to exactly equal this amount).'
            discount_amount:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The approximate discount applied to just this line.

                The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total discount among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the discount to arrive at `discount_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the discount on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
            tax_amount:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The approximate tax applied to just this line.

                The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total tax among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the tax rate to arrive at `tax_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the tax on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
            total_amount:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The non-canonical total amount for the line.

                `subtotal_amount` is the canonical amount for a line. The invoice `total_amount` is derived from the sum of the line `subtotal_amount`s and discounts or taxes applied thereafter.  Therefore, due to rounding or precision errors, the sum of line `total_amount`s may not equal the invoice `total_amount`.
            tiered_unit_price:
              type: boolean
              description: 'When `true`, indicates that the actual pricing scheme for the line was tiered, so the `unit_price` shown is the blended average for all units.'
            period_range_start:
              type: string
              description: |-
                Start date for the period covered by this line. The format is `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.

                * For periodic charges paid in advance, this date will match the billing date, and the end date will be in the future.
                * For periodic charges paid in arrears (e.g. metered charges), this date will be the date of the previous billing, and the end date will be the current billing date.
                * For non-periodic charges, this date and the end date will match.
            period_range_end:
              type: string
              description: |-
                End date for the period covered by this line. The format is `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.

                * For periodic charges paid in advance, this date will match the next (future) billing date.
                * For periodic charges paid in arrears (e.g. metered charges), this date will be the date of the current billing date.
                * For non-periodic charges, this date and the start date will match.
            product_id:
              type: integer
              description: |-
                The ID of the product subscribed when the charge was made.

                This may be set even for component charges, so true product-only (non-component) charges will also have a nil `component_id`.

                The event data is the data that, when combined with the command, results in the output `invoice` found in the `invoice` field.

                The data depends on the event:

                *`apply_payment`*

                * `memo`: The payment memo
                * `original_amount`: The full, original amount of the payment transaction as a string in full units. Incoming payments can be split amongst several invoices, which will result in a `applied_amount` less than the `original_amount`. Example: A $100.99 payment, of which $40.11 is applied to this invoice, will have an `original_amount` of `"100.99"`.
                * `applied_amount`: The amount of the payment applied to this invoice. Incoming payments can be split amongst several invoices, which will result in a `applied_amount` less than the `original_amount`. Example: A $100.99 payment, of which $40.11 is applied to this invoice, will have an `applied_amount` of `"40.11"`.
                * `transaction_time`: The time the payment was removed, in ISO 8601 format, i.e. `"2019-06-07T17:20:06Z"`
                * `payment_method`: A nested data structure detailing the method of payment
                * `transaction_id`: The ID of the original payment (a Chargify-generated identifier)

                *`remove_payment`*

                This data matches the data from `apply_payment`. The amount of the payment being removed is the `applied_amount`.

Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the discount to arrive at `discount_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the discount on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.

                The approximate tax applied to just this line.

                The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total tax among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the tax rate to arrive at `tax_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the tax on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.

                The non-canonical total amount for the line.

                `subtotal_amount` is the canonical amount for a line. The invoice `total_amount` is derived from the sum of the line `subtotal_amount`s and discounts or taxes applied thereafter.  Therefore, due to rounding or precision errors, the sum of line `total_amount`s may not equal the invoice `total_amount`.

                The approximate discount of just this line.

                The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total discount among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the discount to arrive at `discount_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the discount on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
            tax_amount:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The approximate tax of just this line.

                The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total tax among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the tax rate to arrive at `tax_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the tax on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
            total_amount:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The non-canonical total amount for the line.

                `subtotal_amount` is the canonical amount for a line. The invoice `total_amount` is derived from the sum of the line `subtotal_amount`s and discounts or taxes applied thereafter.  Therefore, due to rounding or precision errors, the sum of line `total_amount`s may not equal the invoice `total_amount`.
            tiered_unit_price:
              type: boolean
              description: 'When `true`, indicates that the actual pricing scheme for the line was tiered, so the `unit_price` shown is the blended average for all units.'

                This may be set even for component credits, so true product-only (non-component) credits will also have a nil `component_id`.

            Component price points allows you to charge customers different amounts for the same component. You will be able to define multiple prices and pricing schemes, and then choose which price point to use for each subscription.

            See [Price Points Documentation](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html#price-points) for more information.

        ## API Guidelines

        Our many merchants all use our API for different purposes. API access is included on all plans at no charge because we believe that you are the owner of your data and you should never feel like your data is ‘locked up’.

        However, because the API means there is little or no user-interaction, it can be very easy to create a program or routine that causes an unnecessarily high burden on our system. Even small accounts can generate huge numbers of expensive API requests by accident.

        In order to maintain a high quality of service for everyone, we ask that you be cautious when implementing your API integration to avoid run-away usage that is disproportionate to the size of your account.

        ## Best Practices

        Here are some tips and best-practices to help keep both your site and ours running smoothly.

        ## Getting Subscription States

        You likely want to check if your customer has an active account, has cancelled, or is behind on his/her payments. The best approach is to keep a local cached copy of the subscription’s state in your own database. You can use [Webhooks](#docTextSection:JYqoZ6JmsZn6gcdYk) to keep up-to-date in near real-time on any changes that occur. This keeps your website up, reduces your coupling to Chargify, and ensures both sites remain as fast as possible.

        Avoid querying Chargify in-line as part of a customer’s request to your site. Doing so could result in:

        + Slowing down your own site while the customer waits for a check to Chargify on every request.
        + If there is a network connectivity issue or in the unlikely event that Chargify is down, your site will also break.
        + As you grow and your customers are more active, you will use up huge numbers of API requests that could result in being blocked because of our automatic abuse prevention.

        ## Synchronizing Your Database

        Normally you should keep your local customer database in sync by using [Webhooks](#docTextSection:JYqoZ6JmsZn6gcdYk). But if you think your database has become out of sync with Chargify, then using the API to check the state of all subscriptions may be the only way to ensure consistency.

        It’s perfectly okay to do this as needed. But it should generally only be relied upon in exceptional circumstances or for periodic reconciliation (usually no more than once a month).

        ## Reporting Usage

        When reporting component usage, avoid sending lots of tiny usage amounts. If you charge by the minute for phone calls, for instance:

        + **Don’t** send in a usage for every minute or every phone call individually.
        + **Don’t** send all usage for all customers all at once. Spread it out or wait a short period of time between each request

        Instead:

        + **Do** send a usage report once a day with how much a customer used for the whole day.

        ## Downloading Bulk Data

        Periodically exporting transaction, subscription, or customer data is a common use case. When possible, we recommend using the built-in [Export](https://help.chargify.com/reports/exporting-data.html) functions inside Chargify to generate reports and download the data. This can often be much faster and can significantly lower your API usage.

        ## About Limits & Blocks

        When doing a large synchronization or retrieving a large amount of data, you may trigger a security failsafe used to prevent abuse and protect our site from attacks.

        We don’t want to block small bursts in usage. So instead of immediately rejecting your requests, we will slow and throttle them. If you see your responses coming in slower, do not parallelize your requests or try to make more concurrent requests to speed things up. You’ll only have to wait longer for your requests to get through.

        If you have too many slowed requests, or your individual account queue gets too full with too many concurrent requests, you’ll likely receive an HTTP “429 Too Many Requests” response code with a message: 

          `Your request was denied due to a usage violation. You can track this request with support by referencing …` 

        with a reference code. Please feel free to [contact support](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can help describe what happened and why the request was blocked.

        If you receive a “429 Too Many Requests” response, your code should be prepared to handle it by pausing its queries, waiting a few minutes, and then proceeding slower (or with less concurrency).

        ## API Integration

        Chargify can be integrated with many environments and programming languages via our REST API. Some of our users have contributed their API wrappers in various programming languages. Check out the [API Code Overview](https://developer.chargify.com/content/ecosystem/api-code-samples.html) doc for an introduction to the wrappers and available code samples.

        ## Developer Portal

        We've created a developer focused portal to give your organization a clear and quick overview of how to integrate with Chargify. 

        The developer portal focuses on scenarios for integration and flow of events. We recommend familiarizing yourself with all of the content in the developer portal, as it's a great compliment to our API documentation.

        Here is a sampling of what is available in the developer portal:

        + [Getting Started Guide for Integrators:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/getting-started/authentication.html) Authentication, Guidelines, Sites/Subdomains

        Here you'll find an introduction to how Chargify Direct operates within Chargify. Additionally, we cover some example implementations, as well as troubleshooting.

        ## Testing Guide

        Chargify has compiled a [testing guide](https://help.chargify.com/testing/testing-intro.html) that covers a list of important factors to consider while in the testing phase. Here's a high-level overiew of what's covered in our testing guide:

        + Test credit card basics
        + Test site limits
        + Live mode versus test mode

        We strongly suggest reading over the testing guide, as well as the entire set of application-based documentation to aid in your discovery of the product.

        ## Engage Support

    authentication:
      id: authentication
      name: Authentication
      content: |-
        The API Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS (HTTPS). Your API login credentials are not the same as the credentials you use to log in to the web interface. You must obtain your API credentials separately.

        **Notice**: As of January 2016, you must use TLS >= 1.2 in order to connect to the API. See the TLS [Upgrade Notice](http://help.chargify.com/announcements/tls-upgrade-notice.html) for more information.

        ### Obtaining Your API Credentials

        Your API key can be generated from the “Integrations” tab of your seller dashboard.

        Please see [here](http://help.chargify.com/integrations/api-keys-chargify-direct.html) for more information on obtaining API keys,

        ### Authenticating with your API Credentials

        You will use HTTP Basic Authentication to verify your identity via the API. All requests must come over TLS`/`HTTPS, and be to the subdomain of the Site you wish to access.

        **For example, if your Site’s subdomain is "acme", then you would access the Customer resource at:**
            `https://acme.chargify.com/customers.json`

        **An example using authentication via cURL:**
            `curl -u api-key:x https://subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml`

        **or**
            `curl -i https://<api-key>:x@subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml`

        ### Troubleshooting: Unable to Connect

        If you are unable to connect, the problem is often that you are using an old/unsupported version of SSL or TLS.
        In this case, Chargify will simply drop the connection, and the error message you receive may be cryptic.

        Here are some common error messages that have been reported:

        + The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.
        + `Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.`

        Please, review the information on the [Upgrade Notice](http://help.chargify.com/announcements/tls-upgrade-notice.html) in order to correct the problem.

        ## Transactions Intro

        The Transactions API allows you to view a list of all transactions both for a site and for an individual subscription.

        ## Transaction Array Request

        Requests for `kinds`can be for a singular attribute or an array. Multiple values can be passed in the url, for example:

        ```
        http://example.com?kinds[]=charge&kinds[]=payment&kinds[]=credit
        ```

        ## Transactions Documentation

        Documentation in relation to transactions is broken up into two major sections within Chargify:

        | payment_authorization   | Deprecated. No longer appears in transactions listing                                                                                                                                                                                                      | N/A                                | N/A                                   |

        When making API requests, it is possible to receive an error even though your request actually completed successfully.

        For example, if you submit an API request and it times out, you can’t be sure whether your request was received by Chargify, or not.

        If you simply re-try the request, you _might_ end up with a duplicate transaction.

        ## Uniqueness Token

        In order to prevent these duplicates, Chargify allows you to supply a `uniqueness_token` parameter in any POST or PUT request.

        The value you supply for the `uniqueness_token` should be long and random, like a UUID. The exact format of the value is up to you.

        If a subsequent request with the same uniqueness_token is received within 60 minutes, it will be rejected with a `409 Conflict` response code and a duplicate error message.

        ## Example

        For example, suppose you are making an adjustment on a subscription. Using curl, you send the following POST request, including a `uniqueness_token`.

        ```json
        curl --verbose -u $CHARGIFY_API_KEY:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -X POST \
        -d @adjustment.json https://$CHARGIFY_SUBDOMAIN.chargify.com/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/adjustments.json

        adjustment.json:
            {"adjustment":
                {
                  "amount": "-12.43",
                  "memo": "Credit for outage on 1/31"
                },
                "uniqueness_token": "2731FB23-98AD-4489-BAF6-7D5CE916F766"
            }
        ```

        After you send your request, there is some problem, and the request times out without a valid response instead of the `201 Created` you were hoping for.

        Since you have supplied a `uniqueness_token`, you can safely re-try the request.

        If you receive the expected `201 Created` (or `422 Unprocessable Entity`) response, you can continue as usual knowing that Chargify never received your first request.

        If you receive a `409 Conflict` and a duplicate error message for the re-try, then you know that the first request was received and processed.

        Example 409 Conflict response:

        ```
            < Status: 409 Conflict
            {"errors":["DuplicatePrevention::DuplicateSubmissionError"]}
            
        ```
        Unfortunately, it is not possible to know what the outcome of the first request was, so you cannot automatically assume it was successful.

        Depending on what type of request you were making, it might be possible to gracefully recover by recording some information about the original request, listening for webhooks, and matching up the webhook payload to find out whether the request succeeded or not.

        In other cases, human intervention will be necessary.

        ## Summary

        We hope this feature will help you prevent duplicate transactions during error handling.

        That said, if you are experiencing repeated timeouts, please [open a support ticket](mailto:support@chargify.com) so we can investigate.

        The “Clear Sites” API is method of allowing merchants to clear customers and subscriptions or all data from a site in TEST mode only.

        ## Sites Documentation

        Full documentation on Sites in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/sites/sites-intro.html).

        Specifically, the [Clearing Site Data](http://help.chargify.com/sites/clearing-site-data.html) section is extremely relevant to this endpoint documentation.

        ## Test Mode Limitations

        **This functionality will only work on sites in TEST mode. Attempts to perform this on sites in “live” mode will result in a response of 403 FORBIDDEN.**

        ## Query String Attributes

        The Chargify API allows you initiate an upgrade/downgrade by posting to either as JSON or XML that potentially includes:

        + `cleanup_scope`: Optional, all or customers, the scope of cleanup of the site to be performed. Default is all.

        ## Cleanup Scope Values

        | Cleanup Scope value | Description                                                                                                                         |
        |---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | ```all```           | Will clear all products, customers, and related subscriptions from the site.                                                        |
        | ```customers```     | Will clear only customers and related subscriptions (leaving the,products untouched) for the site. Revenue will also be reset to 0. |

        ## 403 Response Example

        Method: POST

        In this example, attempting to specify a cleanup_scope that isn’t all or customers will result in a “403 FORBIDDEN”.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/sites/clear_data.json?cleanup_scope=bogus
        ```

        Required Parameter: cleanup_scope

        `Response: 403 FORBIDDEN`

        Result: No change will have been made to the site.

        ## Renewal Preview Intro

        Renewal Preview is an object representing a subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal. 

        ## Inclusion of Components

        This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will return the computed billing amount for the base product and the components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview will include billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This means:

        * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint. We do not predict end-of-period values for components, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you may provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the `components` key. See the request body documentation below.

        ## Subscription Side Effects

        You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without any side effects. Plain and simple, this will preview data, not log any changes against a subscription.

        ## Renewal Preview Documentation

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation  [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#next-billing).

        ## Components Intro

        Components are defined and associated with a product family. They become a part of your product offering. These **component definitions** determine what components are named, how they are measured, and how much they cost.

        Components can then be added and “allocated” for each subscription to a product in the product family. These **component line-items** affect how much a subscription will be charged, depending on the current allocations (i.e. 4 IP Addresses, or SSL “enabled”)

        This documentation covers both **component definitions** and **component line-items.** Please understand the difference.

        | unit_name         | (Not required for On/Off Components) The name of the unit of measurement for the component. It should be singular since it will be automatically pluralized when necessary. i.e. “message”, which may then be shown as “5 messages” on a subscription’s component line-item                         |
        | unit_price        | The amount the customer will be charged per unit when the pricing scheme is “per_unit”. For On/Off Components, this is the amount that the customer will be charged when they turn the component on for the subscription.

        ## Component Definition Output Attributes

        Component definitions refer to the components you create that become available to subscriptions. This differs from what we are calling “component line-items”, which detail the attachment of the component to a subscription (and are documented below).

        | id                      | The unique ID assigned to the component by Chargify. This ID can be used to fetch the component from the API.                                                                                                                                                                |

        ## Component Fractional Pricing

        In May 2011, we added the ability to create components with fractional cent pricing (i.e. $0.0012 per unit). To accommodate this change we made some adjustments on our end that altered how prices are stored. Because of this, we have deprecated the `price_in_cents` field in favor of the `unit_price` field. The `price_in_cents` field is still returned for backwards compatibility, but may not accurately represent the current state of the component if it has been updated since the change. We recommend updating your API calls to use the `unit_price` field as soon as possible.

        ## Customers Intro

        You may create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one customer for a given reference value. 

        If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the customer from your own app, i.e. the customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

        ## Adjustments Intro

        Adjustments allow you to change the current balance of a subscription. Adjustments with positive amounts make the balance go up, Adjustments with negative amounts make the balance go down (like Credits).

        ## Adjustments Documentation 

        Full documentation on how to record Adjustments in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/adjustments.html).

        This documentation is focused on how adjustments operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when applying adjustments.

        ## Adjustment Input Attributes

        In order to create an adjustment, you must pass an amount and an optional memo. The amount can be specified by either the `amount` parameter or the `amount_in_cents` parameter. The amount can be specified as a positive or a negative number. Optionally, an `adjustment_method` parameter can be specified.

        | amount            | (either `amount` or `amount_in_cents` is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `10.00` and -$10.00 would be represented as `-10.00`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
        |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents   | (either `amount` or `amount_in_cents` is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `1000` and -$10.00 would be represented as `-1000`. If you pass a value for both `amount` and `amount_in_cents`, the value in `amount_in_cents` will be used and `amount` will be discarded. |
        | memo              | A helpful explanation for the adjustment. This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the assessment of the adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
        | adjustment_method | (Optional) A string that toggles how the adjustment should be applied. If target is passed for this param, the adjustment will automatically set the subscription’s balance to the amount. If left blank, the amount will be added to the current balance.                                                                                                                                                     |
        | period_range_start        | (optional) A date range represents a service period. If a start is provided, an end must be supplied as well. These dates are optional and do not impact the billing of the charge. If provided, the date range will be used for revenue placement on the Finance Report and Revenue Recognition report.                                                               |
        | period_range_end          | (optional) A date range represents a service period. If an end is provided, a start must be supplied as well. These dates are optional and do not impact the billing of the charge. If provided, the date range will be used for revenue placement on the Finance Report and Revenue Recognition report.                                                               |

        ## Adjustment Output Attributes

        When an adjustment is successfully created, a representation of the newly created adjustment will be returned to you as JSON or XML in the message body, with the following attributes:

        | success         | Either true or false, depending on the success of the adjustment. (Note: At this time, all adjustments that are returned will return true here. false may be returned in the future when more options are added to the adjustment creation API) |
        |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        ## Components: Metered Usage Intro

        The Chargify API allows you to record metered component usage by posting JSON or XML that includes:

        + `quantity`: The amount of usage being reported
        + `memo`: An optional description of the usage

        Metered usage is cumulative over the billing period. You may choose to report usage as often as you wish, and Chargify sums and accumulates the quantity of each usage into a running balance (see `unit_balance` on [Component Line Items](https://reference.chargify.com/v1/component-line-items/component-line-items). Charges for metered usage balance are assessed on the `next_billing_date` of the subscription. In other words, metered usage is tallied and charged at the end of the subscriber's current recurring period.

        You may choose to report metered usage to Chargify as often as you wish. You may report usage as it happens. You may also report usage periodically, such as each night or once per billing period. If usage events occur in your system very frequently (on the order of thousands of times an hour), it is best to accumulate usage into batches on your side, and then report those batches less frequently, such as daily. This will ensure you remain below any API throttling limits.

        ## Recording Multiple Usage Limitations

        As of the time of this publication there is not a method to record multiple usage of a metered component against a subscription.

        ## Metered Components versus Quantity-based Components

        Metered components allow you to record "usage" of a component, such as text messages. These types of components reset to 0 at the beginning of each billing period.

        On the other hand, for quantity-based components, you would record an allocation. Quantity-based components do not reset every month. They will charge the same quantity of components one billing period to the next.

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html). Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources:

        ## Charges Intro

        This method of recording a charge against a subscription is referred to as a **"One Time Charge"** in the Chargify Help Documentation.

        For “live” subscriptions (i.e. subscriptions that are not canceled or expired), you have the ability to attach a **one-time-charge** of an arbitrary amount.

        In general, the subscription must have a payment method in order to support adding a charge.  Exceptions to this are if the charge is accrued to the next renewal, or if the subscription is on invoice billing.

        ## Charges Documentation

        Full documentation on how to record a one-time-charge in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/one-time-charges.html).

        ## Charge Input Attributes

        In order to create a charge, you must pass an amount and a memo. The amount can be specified by either the amount parameter or the amount_in_cents parameter.

        | amount                    | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `10.00`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
        |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents           | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `1000`. If you pass a value for both ‘amount’ and ‘amount_in_cents’, the value in ‘amount_in_cents’ will be used and ‘amount’ will be discarded. |
        | memo                      | (required) A helpful explanation for the charge. This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the assessment of the charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
        | use_negative_balance      | (optional) This option specifies whether or not a negative current balance should be used when creating the new charge. If true, use the negative balance on the subscription to calculate the charge. If false, do not use the negative balance. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0 `for `false`.                                       |
        | delay_capture             | (optional) If true, don’t attempt to immediately capture a payment for this charge (instead, wait until the next assessment date). Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`. Note if this option is used use_negative_balance is assumed as false.                                                                                |
        | accrue_on_failure         | (optional) If true, the charge will be added to the subscription whether or not the payment succeeds. If false, only the failed payment will be recorded, and the balance will not be increased. This attribute is ignored if `delay_capture` is true. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`. Defaults to `false`.             |
        | taxable                   | (optional, default `false`) If true, taxes will be assessed on the charge. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`.  This setting is ignored if the customer tax_exempt flag is true.                                                                                                                                            |
        | payment_collection_method | (optional, default,`automatic`) For subscriptions on invoice billing, when `delay_capture`: is set to `false`, and `payment_collection_method` is set to `invoice`, a mid-period invoice will be created from this charge.

        ## Events Intro

        Chargify Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.

        ## Events Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, "Events" are referred to as "Site Activity".  Full documentation on how to record view Events / Site Activty in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/sites/site-activity.html).

        ## Events Fields and Event Type

        ## Event Specific Data

        Event Specific Data

        Each event type has its own `event_specific_data` specified.

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_product_change` event:

        ```
        {
            "event": {
                "id": 351,
                "key": "subscription_product_change",
                "message": "Product changed on Marky Mark's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
                "subscription_id": 205,
                "event_specific_data": {
                    "new_product_id": 3,
                    "previous_product_id": 2
                },
                "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
            }
        }
        ```

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_state_change` event:

        ```
         {
             "event": {
                 "id": 353,
                 "key": "subscription_state_change",
                 "message": "State changed on Marky Mark's subscription to Pro from trialing to active",
                 "subscription_id": 205,
                 "event_specific_data": {
                     "new_subscription_state": "active",
                     "previous_subscription_state": "trialing"
                 },
                 "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:33-05:00"
             }
         }

        ## Custom Fields: Metadata Intro

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.**

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**


        Chargify Metadata is used to add your own meaningful values to subscription or customer records.
        Metadata is associated to a customer or subscription, and corresponds to a Metafield. When creating a new metadata object for a given record, if the metafield is not present it will be created.

        ## Metadata Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata. 

        Full documentation on how to create Custom Fields in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/custom-fields/custom-fields-intro.html).

        For additional documentation on how to record data within custom fields, please see our subscription-based documentation [here.](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#custom-fields)

        ## Metadata versus Metafields

        Metadata is the information that populates the metafield.

        ## Metadata limits

        Metadata values are limited to 2kB in size. Additonally, there are limits on the number of unique “names” available per resource. See [Metafields documentation](#docTextSection:BDXuRKX5n8K4T6Jsh).

        ## Server Response

        The following fields are returned from GET (read) operations.

        | name        | The name of the attribute that is added to the resource.  |
        |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | value       | The value of the attribute that was added to the resource |
        | resource_id | The resource id that the metadata belongs to              |

        ## Payment Profile Intro

        Payment Profiles house the credit card, ACH (Authorize.Net or Stripe only,) or PayPal (Braintree only,) data for a customer. The payment information is attached to the customer within Chargify, as opposed to the Subscription itself.


        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html#taxes)

        ## Payment Profile Documentation

        Full documentation on how Payment Profiles operate within Chargify can be located under the following links:

        + [Subscriber Payment Details](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#payment-details)
        + [Self Service Pages](http://help.chargify.com/public-pages/self-service-pages.html) (Allows credit card updates by Subscriber)
        + [Public Signup Pages payment settings](http://help.chargify.com/public-pages/public-signup-page-settings.html#credit-card-settings)

        ## Payment Profile Input Attributes

        The following information describes the input attributes that can be used for creating Payment Profiles.

        | payment_type             | (Optional) Default is `credit_card`. May be `bank_account` or `credit_card` or `paypal_account`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

        ## Payments Intro

        Chargify allows you to record payments that occur **outside** of the normal flow of payment processing.
        These payments are considered **external payments**. A common case to apply such a payment is when a customer pays by check or some other means for their subscription.

        ## Payment Documentation

        ## Custom Fields: Metafields Intro

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.**

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**

        Chargify Metafields are used to add meaningful attributes to subscription and customer resources.

        Metafield are the place where you will set up your resource to accept additional data. It is scoped to the site instead of a specific customer or subscription. Think of it as the key, and Metadata as the value on every record.

        ## Metafields Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata. 

        Full documentation on how to create Custom Fields in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/custom-fields/custom-fields-intro.html).

        For additional documentation on how to record data within custom fields, please see our subscription-based documentation [here.](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#custom-fields)

        ## Metafields vs Metadata 

        Metadata is the information that populates the metafield.

        ## Metafields "On-the-Fly"

        It is possible to create Metafields “on the fly” when you create your Metadata – if a non-existant name is passed when creating Metadata, a Metafield for that key will be automatically created. The Metafield API, however, gives you more control over your “keys”.

        ## Metafield Limitations

        Each site is limited to 200 unique Metafields (i.e. keys, or names) per-resource.

        ## Metafields Scope

        The scope field has four acceptable attributes, which dictate where metafields will appear:

        + portal
        + csv
        + invoices
        + statements
         
        If configuring metafields in the Admin UI or via the API, be careful sending updates to metafields with the scope attribute – if a partial update is sent it will overwrite the current configuration.

        ## CSV Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude in csv exports.

        ```“csv”: “1”```

        ## Statement Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude in statments.

        ```“statements”: “1”```

        ### Invoice Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude on invoices.

        ```“invoices”: “1”```

        ### Billing Portal Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude on invoices.

        ```"portal": "1"```

        ## Metafield Types

        Metafields can have three different types defined by the `input_type` attribute:

        + text (the default)
        + dropdown
        + radio

        The `input_type` indicates how data should be added to the metafield. For example, a `text` type is just a string, so a given metafield of this type can have any value attached. On the other hand, `dropdown` and `radio` have a set of allowed values that can be input, and appear differently on a Public Signup Page.

        Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/upgrades-downgrades.html).

        ## Migration vs. Product Change

        If you want a migration with proration, then you want to continue with the methods listed below. However, if you just want to change the product the customer is subscribed to (with no proration) then you’ll just want to update the [subscription product.](#endpoint:4D8tKPkKC3So5X6qs)

        ## Input Attributes

        The Chargify API allows you initiate an upgrade/downgrade by posting JSON or XML that includes:

        | product_id or product_handle | The ID or handle of the `target` Product. A Subscription can be migrated to another product for both the current Product Family and another Product Family. **Note: Going to another Product Family, components will not be migrated as well.** |
        |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | product_price_point_id or product_price_point_handle | The ID or handle of the specified product's price point. This can be passed to migrate to a non-default price point. |
        | include_trial                | Boolean, default `0`. If `1` is sent the customer will migrate to the new product with a trial if one is available. If `0` is sent, the trial period will be ignored.                                                                           |
        | include_initial_charge       | Boolean, default 0. If 1 is sent initial charges will be assessed. If 0 is sent initial charges will be ignored.                                                                                                                                |
        | include_coupons              | Boolean, default `1`. If `1` (or nothing) is sent, any coupons associated with the subscription will be applied to the migration. If `0` is sent, coupons will not be applied.                                                                  |
        | preserve_period              | Boolean, default `0`. If `0` (or nothing) is sent, the subscription's billing period will be reset to today and the full price of the new product will be charged. If `1` is sent, the billing period will not change and a prorated charge will be issued for the new product.                                                                  

        ## Alternate Request Body Options

        When using the migration endpoint, there are two alternative options you can use for your requests.

        ### Use Handle 

        You may elect to use `product_handle` instead of `product_id`, and  `product_price_point_handle` instead of `product_price_point_id`:

        ```
        {
            "migration": {
                "product_handle": "silver-plan",
                "product_price_point_handle": "199"
                "include_trial": false,
                "include_initial_charge": false,
                "include_coupons": true,
                "preserve_period": true
            }
        }
        ```

        ### Nested Preserve Period

        There's an alternative method to send the `preserve_period` key/value pair. Please note both published ways will work with the API:


        ```
        {
         "migration": {
          "product_handle": "diversity_production_500k",
          "include_trial": false,
          "include_initial_charge": false,
          "include_coupons": true,
          "proration": {
              "preserve_period": true
          }
         }
        }
        ```

        ## Failed Migrations

        One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a subscription to it's current product. Please be aware of this issue!

        ## Billing Portal Intro

        If your customer has been invited to the Billing Portal, then they will receive a link to manage their subscription (the “Management URL”) automatically at the bottom of their statements, invoices, and receipts. **This link changes periodically for security and is only valid for 65 days.** 

        If you need to provide your customer their Management URL through other means, you can retrieve it via the API. Because the URL is cryptographically signed with a timestamp, it is not possible for merchants to generate the URL without requesting it from Chargify.

        In order to prevent abuse & overuse, we ask that you request a new URL only when absolutely necessary. Management URLs are good for 65 days, so you should re-use a previously generated one as much as possible. If you use the URL frequently (such as to display on your website), please **do not** make an API request to Chargify every time.

        ## Billing Portal Documentation

        Full documentation on how the Billing Portal operates within the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/billing-portal/introduction.html).

        This documentation is focused on how the to configure the Billing Portal Settings, as well as Subscriber Interaction and Merchant Management of the Billing Portal. 

        ## Rules for Management Link API

        + When retrieving a management URL, multiple requests for the same customer in a short period will return the **same** URL
        + We will not generate a new URL for 15 days
        + You must cache and remember this URL if you are going to need it again within 15 days
        + Only request a new URL after the `new_link_available_at` date
        + You are limited to 15 requests for the same URL. If you make more than 15 requests before `new_link_available_at`, you will be blocked from further Management URL requests (with a response code `429`)

      content: "## Components: Quantity Allocations Intro\n\nThe “Allocated Quantity” may be set for the Quantity Component on specific subscriptions via the API at the time the subscription is created, or at any time thereafter.\n\nFull documentation on how to record Allocations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html). \n\nThis documentation is focused on how allocations operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when recording allocations.\n\nThis documentation also goes into greater detail on how proration is taken into consideration when applying component allocations.\n\n## Quantity-based Components Versus Metered-based components\n\nQuantity-based components allow you to record allocation/purchase of an add-on resource or component. Quantity-based components do not reset every month. They will charge the same quantity of components one billing period to the next.\n\nMetered components allow you to record \"usage\" of a component, such as text messages. These types of components reset to 0 at the beginning of each billing period.\n\n## Quantity-based Components Documentation\n\nFull documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html).

        ## Subscription Preview

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a subscription by POSTing the same JSON or XML as for a subscription creation.

        ## Subscription Preview Documentation

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation  [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#next-billing).

        ## Input Attributes

        A Subscription Preview is an object representing a proposed subscription’s initial assessment and first renewal, including discounts and taxes. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged if they complete their signup.

        For full information, please see our API documentation on how to [Create a Subscription](#endpoint:uw4BjXCFjTzSYYSaA).

        A `subscription_preview` object with a `current_billing_manifest` and a `next_billing_manifest` containing the following fields:

        | start_date                | The timestamp for the beginning of the period covered by the manifest                                                             |
        |---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | end_date                  | The timestamp for the end of the period covered by the manifest                                                                   |
        | period_type               | The type of billing period: recurring for previews                                                                                |
        | existing_balance_in_cents | An integer representing the amount of the subscription’s current balance. Will be zero since the subscription does not yet exist. |
        | subtotal_in_cents         | An integer representing the amount of the total pre-tax, pre-discount charges that would be assessed                              |
        | total_discount_in_cents   | An integer representing the amount of the coupon discounts that would be applied                                                  |
        | total_tax_in_cents        | An integer representing the total tax charges that would be assessed                                                              |
        | total_in_cents            | An integer representing the total amount owed, less any discounts, that would be assessed                                         |
        | line_items                | An array of objects representing the individual transactions that would be created for this subscription                          |

        ## Side effects

        A subscription will not be created by sending a POST to this endpoint. It is meant to serve as a prediction.

        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        This endpoint will preview taxes applicable to a purchase. In order for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must be met:

        + Taxes must be configured on the subscription
        + The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or component, or combination of the two.
        + The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping address in order to calculate tax

        For more information about creating taxable previews, please see our documentation guide on how to create [taxable subscriptions.](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html#creating-taxable-subscriptions)

        ## Non-taxable Subscriptions

        If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax, please feel free to leave off the billing information.

        ## Payment Profile Attributes

        These attributes can be updated by sending a PUT request to the [payment profile](https://reference.chargify.com/v1/payment-profiles/update-the-payment-profile) endpoint.

        If you are creating a subscription with a payment profile, the attribute to send will be `credit_card_attributes` or `bank_account_attributes` for ACH and Direct Debit. That said, when you read the subscription after creation, we return the profile details under `credit_card` or `bank_account`.

        | payment_profile_id         | The Payment Profile ID of an existing card or bank account, which belongs to an existing customer to use for payment for this subscription. If the card, bank account, or customer does not exist already, or if you want to use a new (unstored) card or bank account for the subscription, use `payment_profile_attributes` instead to create a new payment profile along with the subscription. (This value is available on an existing subscription via the API as `credit_card` > id or `bank_account` > id) |

        | next_billing_at                       | (Optional) Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on “Date/Time Format” in our [subscriptions import documentation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html).

The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by `next_billing_at`. If you do not provide a value for `next_billing_at`, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created. See further notes in the section on Importing Subscriptions. |

        ## Refunds - External Intro

        Use this endpoint to record refunds done outside of Chargify, such as directly at the gateway or by sending a check to the subscriber.

        | amount          | The amount represented as a string with two decimal places, for example 14.50.                               |
        |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents | The amount represented as a string in cents. For example if the refund was for $14.50, you would pass `1450` |
        | memo            | A description of why the refund occured                                                                      |

        Note that external refunds will reduce revenue, but they do not affect the balance due for the subscription.

        ## Refunds Documentation

        Full documentation on how to apply a refund in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/refunds.html).

        ## External Refunds versus Refunds

        It's important to note that 2 types of refunds can be created via the API. 

        + [Refunds](#docTextSection:PdfZnp5bXtPjCr7Qg) interact with the Merchant's gateway and return funds directly to the Subscriber's bank.
        + External refunds log a refund against the Subscriber's entry in Chargify. No funds are returned to the subscriber's bank account. 

        ## External Refund Use Case
         
        The use case for this type of refund is as follows:

        + You have a gateway that does not do **direct** refunds back to a Subscribers's bank account
        + To process a refund, you process the refund **through** your gateway account.
        + Afterwards, record the refund within Chargify

        ## Statements Intro

        Chargify Statements give you and your customers a breakdown of Subscription charges, payments, credits, and activity on a period-by-period basis. A Statement is similar to an “Invoice” because it is marked as currently paid or unpaid. Statements display all account activity for a specific usage period.

        ## Statements Documentation

        Documentation for Statements in the Chargify UI can be accessed via the following links / topics:

        + [Statements Reference](http://help.chargify.com/statements/statements-intro.html)
        + [Viewing Statements](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#statements)
        + [Statement Settings](http://help.chargify.com/settings/statements.html)

        ## Statement Presentation

        The Statements API offers three ways to easily render a statement on your site. You can include a text representation of the statement or one of two HTML views that can be styled to your liking.

        | text_view       | A text representation of the statement             |
        |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
        | basic_html_view | A simple HTML representation of the statement      |
        | html_view       | A more robust HTML representation of the statement |

        Rendering individual statements can also be done as PDF by using the Accept/Content-Type header application/pdf or appending .pdf as the `<format>` portion of the URL.

        ## Subscription Override Intro

        This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that are usually managed for you automatically. Some of the fields can be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be set using this endpoint.

        This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Chargify data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before you started using Chargify. For example, you may choose to import your historical subscription data, and would like the activation and cancellation dates in Chargify to match your existing historical dates. Chargify does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API.

        Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create and update endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually managed by Chargify, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your own.**

        ## Subscriptions Override Documentation

        There is no current complimentary documentation for this endpoint. 

        ## Fields That Can Be Manipulated

        | activated_at         | Can be used to record an external signup date. Chargify uses this field to record when a subscription first goes active (either at signup or at trial end)                |
        |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | canceled_at          | Can be used to record an external cancellation date. Chargify sets this field automatically when a subscription is canceled, whether by request or via dunning.           |
        | cancellation_message | Can be used to record a reason for the original cancellation.                                                                                                             |
        | expires_at           | Can be used to record an external expiration date. Chargify sets this field automatically when a subscription expires (ceases billing) after a prescribed amount of time. |
        | current_period_starts_at | Can only be used when a subscription is unbilled and the value passed must be before the current date and time. Allows you to set when the period started so mid period component allocations have the correct proration.
        No other fields are currently available. Attempting to set any other fields will cause a `400 Bad Request` response. You only need to send the fields you would like to change.

        Note that changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription.

        The fields should be nested beneath a `subscription` key – see the examples below for more information.

        ## Headers

        + `Accept`: set to either `application/json` or `application/xml` depending on the top of response you desire
        + `Content-Type`: set to either `application/json` or `application/xml` depending on the top of request body you send

        ## Referrals Intro

        You can verify if a referral code is valid using the `validate` method. This method is useful for validating referral codes that are entered by a customer.

        ## Referrals Documentation

        Full documentation on how to use the referrals feature in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/referrals/introduction.html).

        ## Server Response

        If the referral code is valid the status code will be `200` and the referral code will be returned. If the referral code is invalid, a `404` response will be returned.

        ## API Overview

        The Chargify API allows you to interact with our system programmatically from your own application. Using the API you interact with Resources such as:

        - Products
        - Subscriptions
        - Customers
        - etc.

        The API attempts to conform to the [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) design principles.
        You interact with the resources exposed via the API by accessing resource collection and element URIs using the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
        Chargify accepts and returns both JSON and XML data via the API.

        You’ll likely need access to a web developer or programmer (if you’re not one) to get the most use out of the API.

        ## Available Formats: JSON and XML

        JSON is the primary and recommended format for use with the Chargify API.  XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for Merchants who require it.

        ## Authentication

        Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS >= 1.2 (HTTPS), as described in [API Authentication](https://developer.chargify.com/content/getting-started/authentication.html)

        ## URL

        The URL for API requests includes the subdomain of the Site you are working with:

        `https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/<resource URI>`

        ## Response Data

        Response data is sent as either XML or JSON, depending on the type of data requested (`HTTP Content-Type` header) or the type specified as being accepted (HTTP `Accept` header).

        GETs for individual statements & invoices may also be requested as PDF using `application/pdf` or appending `.pdf` to the resource URI.

        Response codes are sent via the normal HTTP Response Code, and are documented separately for each resource.

        For boolean fields, please note that a value of `null` may be considered as false. However, this is not true across all cases. Please excercise good judgement here, or contact support with any questions.

        For example:

        + `null` can define that there's no data available for that attribute


        ## Response Time Zones

        API responses from Chargify are sent with the timezone of current Chargify site. 

        Alternately, webhooks sent from Chargify globally utilize EST as the timezone for all content in the body of the payload. 

        ## Request Data

        POST and PUT request data may be formatted as either XML (`application/xml`) or JSON (`application/json`). For best results, you should set your HTTP `Content-Type` request header accordingly, although you may also specify your format by appending `.xml` or `.json` extensions on to the resource URI.

        Note that Chargify does not accept PUT or POST data sent as query params or form encoded data – data must be sent as either XML or JSON. If you fail to set your `Content-Type` to either `application/xml` or `application/json`, your request may fail due to triggering of forgery protection mechanisms.

        ## Debugging

        If you’re having difficulty executing a request via our API, try the simplest thing and attempt your request via the curl command-line tool, as shown in the below example. Add the `--verbose` flag to your request to receive even more debugging information.

        Another handy tool is [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/). You can use this to intercept your request to see exactly what is being sent.

        If you are unable to connect at all, check that you are using TLS 1.2 or better, and review the information in [API Authentication Troubleshooting.](#docTextSection:xnGtyxFy5nLWhGB34)

        ## Backwards Compatibility

        We consider the following changes to be backwards compatible and may make them without advance notice:

        + Adding new API endpoints, or adding new attributes in the responses of existing endpoints
        + Adding new optional parameters to be sent to existing API endpoints
        + Adding new fields to exported data
        + Changing the type or length of any of the ID attributes
          + For example, most IDs are currently integers, but you should not assume that this will always be the case.

        In addition, you should not depend on the order of attributes within the API response as this may change.

        Chargify does not provide notifications for additions that are clearly defined as backwards compatible.

        ## Examples

        The following examples use the curl command-line tool to execute API requests.

        ### Subscription Listing

        **Request**

            curl -u <api_key>:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions.json

      content: "## Subscriptions Import Intro\n\nSubscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the following scenarios:\n\n+ You already have existing subscriptions with specific start and renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify\n+ You already have credit cards stored in your provider’s vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens\n\nBefore importing, you should have already set up your products to match your offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes.\n\n## Subscriptions Import Documentation\n\nFull documentation on how import Subscriptions using the **import tool** in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html).\n\n## Adding components during import\n\nComponents may also be included in the import. See [Product Components](#docTextSection:EseRiQJY4GMtnkfyR) for more information.\n\n## Subscription Input Attributes\n\nThe following _additions_ to the subscription input attributes make imports possible.\n\n| next_billing_at     \t| Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on “Date/Time Format” in our [subscriptions import documentation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html). If you provide a next_billing_at timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription. In fact, no payment will be captured at all. The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by next_billing_at. If you do not provide a value for next_billing_at, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created. \t|\n|---------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\n| previous_billing_at \t| Providing a previous_billing_at that is in the past will set the `current_period_starts_at` when the subscription is created. It will also set `activated_at` if not explicitly passed during the subscription import. Can only be used if `next_billing_at` is also passed. Using this option will allow you to set the period start for the subscription so mid period component allocations have the correct prorated amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \t|\n| import_mrr          \t| Optional. Setting this attribute to `true` will cause the subscription's MRR to be added to your MRR analytics immediately. For this value to be honored, a `next_billing_at` must be present and set to a future date. This key/value will not be returned in the subscription response body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \t|\n\n## Payment Profile Attributes\n\n+ `payment_profile_attributes`\n\n| vault_token          | the “token” provided by your vault storage for an already stored payment profile                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| customer_vault_token | (only for Authorize.Net CIM storage): the customerProfileId for the owner of the customerPaymentProfileId provided as the vault_token                                                                                                                                                    |\n| current_vault        | the vault that stores the payment profile with the provided vault_token.

May be `visa`, `master`, `discover`, `american_express`, `diners_club`, `jcb`, `switch`, `solo`, `dankort`, `maestro`, `forbrugsforeningen`, or `laser` |\n\n## Payment Profile Attributes vs Credit Card Attributes\n\n`payment_profile_attributes` are the same thing as `credit_card_attributes` used elsewhere in the documentation. The two keys are interchangeable, pick one to use but not both. Most new documentation will refer to `payment_profile_attributes` \n\n## Current Vault\n\nIf you are using a Legacy gateway such as \"eWAY Rapid (Legacy)\" or \"Stripe (Legacy)\" then please contact Support for further instructions on subscription imports.\n\n## Braintree Blue (Braintree v2) Imports\n\nBraintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway, please provide the `vault_token` parameter with the value from Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the “Payment Profile Token”. At this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree Blue gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree Customer.\n\nWhen importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type` to `paypal_account`.\n\n## Webhooks During Import\n\nIf no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal. If you do set a future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the webhooks are fired when the subscription is created. Keep reading for more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which scenarios.\n\n### Successful creation with Billing Date\n\nScenario: If `next_billing_at` provided\n\n+ `signup_success`\n+ `billing_date_change`\n\n### Successful creation without Billing Date\n\nScenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided\n\n+ `signup_success`\n+ `payment_success`\n\n### Unsuccessful creation\n\nScenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided\n\n+ signup_failure\n\n### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached:\n\n+ `renewal_success or renewal_failure`\n+ `payment_success or payment_failure`\n\n### Date and Time Formats\n\nWe will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of next_billing_at in to a date or time. For best results, use a known format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC 2822 or ISO 8601 .\n\nThe following are all equivalent and will work as input to `next_billing_at`:\n\n```\nAug 06 2030 11:34:00 -0400\nAug 06 2030 11:34 -0400\n2030-08-06T11:34:00-04:00\n8/6/2030 11:34:00 EDT\n8/6/2030 8:34:00 PDT\n2030-08-06T15:34:00Z\n```\nYou may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be noon\n\n```\n2010-08-06\n```"

        ## Webhooks Intro

        The Webhooks API allows you to view a list of all webhooks and to selectively resend individual or groups of webhooks.
        Webhooks will be sent on endpoints specified by you. Endpoints can be added via API or Web UI.
        There is also an option to enable / disable webhooks via API request. 

        ## Webhooks Documentation

        We recommend that you review Chargify's webhook documentation located in our help site. The following resources will help guide you on how to use webhooks in Chargify, in addition to these webhook endpoints:

        + [Adding/editing new webhooks](https://help.chargify.com/settings/webhooks.html)
        + [Webhooks introduction and delivery information](https://help.chargify.com/webhooks/introduction.html)

        + [Available webhooks and payloads](https://help.chargify.com/webhooks/webhooks-reference.html#example-payloads)


        ## Webhook Attributes

        | <div style="width:200px">**Attribute**</div> | **Description** |
        |---------------|-----------------|
        |`id`| The unique identifier for the webhooks (unique across all of Chargify). This is not changed on a retry/replay of the same webhook, so it may be used to avoid duplicate action for the same event.
        |`successful`| A boolean flag describing whether the webhook was accepted by the webhook endpoint for the most recent attempt. (Acceptance is defined by receiving a “200 OK” HTTP response within a reasonable timeframe, i.e. 15 seconds)
        |`event` | A string describing which event type produced the given webhook
        |`body` | The data sent within the webhook post
        |`signature` | The calculated webhook signature
        |`signature_hmac_sha_256` | The calculated HMAC-SHA-256 webhook signature
        |`created_at` | Timestamp indicating when the webhook was created
        |`accepted_at` | Timestamp indicating when the webhook was accepted by the merchant endpoint. When a webhook is explicitly replayed by the merchant, this value will be cleared until it is accepted again.
        |`last_sent_at` | Timestamp indicating when the most recent attempt was made to send the webhook
        | `last_error_at` | Timestamp indicating when the last non-acceptance occurred. If a webhook is later resent and accepted, this field will be cleared.
        | `last_sent_url` | The url that the endpoint was last sent to.
        | `last_error` | Text describing the status code and/or error from the last failed attempt to send the Webhook. When a webhook is retried and accepted, this field will be cleared.

        ## Endpoint Attributes

        |**Attribute** | **Description** |
        |----------|-------------|
        | `id`     | The unique identifier for resource. Use this id to update an endpoint. |
        | `url`    | Your API url of the webhook integration. |
        | `site_id`| ID of your site in Chargify. | 
        | `status` | A boolean flag describing wheter endpoint is disabled or enabled. |
        | `webhooks_subscriptions` | An array of subscribed events keys, each key is a string (e.g. `payment_success`). Visit [Webhook reference](https://help.chargify.com/webhooks/webhooks-reference.html) to learn more.

        ## Coupon Subcodes Intro

        Coupon Subcodes allow you to create a set of unique codes that allow you to expand the use of one coupon.

        For example:

        Master Coupon Code: 

        + SPRING2020

        Coupon Subcodes: 

        + SPRING90210
        + DP80302
        + SPRINGBALTIMORE

        Coupon subcodes can be administered in the Admin Interface or via the API.

        When creating a coupon subcode, you must specify a coupon to attach it to using the coupon_id. Valid coupon subcodes are all capital letters, contain only letters and numbers, and do not have any spaces. Lowercase letters will be capitalized before the subcode is created.

        ## Coupon Subcodes Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create coupon subcodes in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-coupons.html#coupon-codes).

        Additionally, for documentation on how to apply a coupon to a Subscription within the Chargify UI, please see our documentation [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#coupon).

        ReasonCodes are a way to gain a high level view of why your customers are cancelling the subcription to your product or service.

        Add a set of churn reason codes to be displayed in-app and/or the Chargify Billing Portal. As your subscribers decide to cancel their subscription, learn why they decided to cancel. 

        ## ReasonCode Documentation

        Full documentation on how Reason Codes operate within Chargify can be located under the following links.

        ## Components: On/Off Toggling

        The Chargify API allows you to toggle an on/off component by posting JSON or XML. This is helpful in the case where the subscription has already been created. By this method, you are recording the usage of this on/off component against the subscription.

        ## Proration Schemes

        ## Component Line-Item Input Attributes

        The attributes listed in the following sections should be nested under the `component` key, e.g. the following JSON could be used to update the `allocated_quantity` on a Component Line-Item:

        ```
          {
            "component": {
              "allocated_quantity": 23
            }
          }
        ```

        ### Inputs for Quantity-Based Line-Items

        + `allocated_quantity` The current allocation for the component on the given subscription.

        For more, see also [API: Quantity Component Allocations](#docTextSection:ySykKNKfEXRJ5CgTK).

        ### Inputs for On/Off Line-Items

        + `allocated_quantity` Use `1` for on and `0` for off.

        ### Inputs for Metered Line-Items

        The Metered Component usages for a subscription are managed through the [Metered Usage API](#docTextSection:Qw7A6cxbCxbSkZrnM)

        ## Component Line-Item Output Attributes

        All component line-item kinds share the following attributes:

        + `subscription_id`
        + `component_id`
        + `name`
        + `unit_name`
        + `kind`

        Then, each line-item has an indication of the current allocation on the given subscription, depending on the `kind`:

        | allocated_quantity | Provided when kind is `quantity_based_componen`t or on_off_component (`1` for on and `0` for off)   |
        |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | unit_balance       | Provided when kind is `metered_component` and gives the TOTAL of all reported usages for the period |

        ## Coupons Intro

        Coupons can be administered in the Chargify application or created via API. Please view our section on [creating coupons](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-coupons.html) for more information. 

        Additionally, for documentation on how to apply a coupon to a subscription within the Chargify UI, please see our documentation [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#coupon).

        ## Flat Amount v. Discount

        In this endpoint, there are two JSON examples listed on how to create coupons. The first example is how to create a percentage based coupon, using `percentage`. This server response indicates a percentage based amount as the coupon's attributes, versus a flat amount.

        The second example is how to create a coupon for a flat amount using `amount_in_cents` as the parameter to define the discount amount.

        Please be aware of the different types of coupons that can be created in Chargify.

        ## Coupon Attributes

        When creating a coupon, you must specify a product family using the `product_family_id`. If no `product_family_id` is passed, the first product family available is used. You will also need to formulate your URL to cite the Product Family ID in your request.

        ## Offers Intro

        Offers allow you to package complicated combinations of products, components and coupons into a convenient package which can then be subscribed to just like products.

        Once an offer is defined it can be used as an alternative to the product when creating subscriptions.

        ## Offers Documentation

        Full documentation on how to use offers in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/offers/offers-introduction.html).

        ## API Access Limitations

        There are a few scenarios that may end up in causing an API request to be blocked even with correct credentials.
        **Please note:** All relevant API requests will be blocked if any of the below conditions are true. These limitations also apply to [Chargify Direct](https://developer.chargify.com/content/chargify-direct/chargify-direct.html).

        Those scenarios are as follows:

        - Your Chargify subscription is canceled.
        - Your Chargify trial has reached an end.
        - The site you're making a request for is in the process of ["clearing site data"](https://help.chargify.com/sites/clearing-site-data.html)
          - _Note: any API request for another site that is in a good state will NOT be blocked_
        - The site you're making a request for has been deleted.
          - _Note: any API request for another site that is in a good state will NOT be blocked_

        Read more about your Chargify subscription [here](https://help.chargify.com/my-account/chargify-subscription.html)

        ## What happens when an API request is blocked

        The request will fail with a `422` http status code. The response will also include a message explaining the reason for the request being blocked. For example:

        - If your Chargify subscription is canceled:

        ```json
        {
          "errors" => [
            [0] "Your Chargify account has been canceled. Please contact support@chargify.com to reactivate."
          ]
        }
        ```

        - If your Chargify trial has reached and end and you attempted to make an API request, the response body will look like:

        ```json
        {
          "errors" => [
            [0] "Your trial has ended, please contact sales."
          ]
        }
        ```

        - If the site you're making a request for is in the process of ["clearing site data"](https://help.chargify.com/sites/clearing-site-data.html):

        ```json
        {
          "errors" => [
            [0] "Site data clearing is in progress. Please try later."
          ]
        }
        ```

        - If the site you're making a request for has been deleted:

        ```json
        {
          "errors" => [
            [0] "This site has been deleted."
          ]
        }
        ```

        ## Single Page Applications

        Please note that it is NOT possible to make API requests directly from the customer's browser or device.  Doing so would expose your API key on the client side, and anyone who has that key has full access to all of your Chargify data. 

        Instead you will need to take care to tokenize sensitive information by using [Chargify.js](https://developer.chargify.com/content/chargify-js/chargify-js.html) or a similar JavaScript library provided by your gateway, and then post the token and other information to your own server, from which you can make the API call to Chargify.

        ### Troubleshooting

        If you attempt to make a Chargify API request directly from the customer's browser, you may see an error such as: 

        ```Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.```

        ```Origin 'https://example.com' is therefore not allowed access.` `The response had HTTP status code 404.```

        This is an error message indicating that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not enabled on the Chargify server.

        ## API Compatibility for Relationship Invoicing

        This section describes the API for the new, [Relationship Invoicing](https://help.chargify.com/invoices/index.html) style of invoices introduced in January 2018.

        If you are an existing customer from prior to January 2018 or have not otherwise explicitly opted into this new style of invoices, you are probably looking for the old "Invoices" section that describes [invoice-billing legacy-style invoices.](docTextSection:JYyHXetBrWb9vjMJF)

        These new invoices provide a single representation of all of your Chargify billing, whether you collect automatically or via remittance.

        ## About Decimal Numbers

        In order to prevent losing precision, we serialize decimal numbers as strings instead of as JSON numbers.

        We recommend parsing these strings into their decimal equivalent using a decimal number library in your programming language (i.e. `BigDecimal` in Ruby) instead of relying on floating point values or arithmetic.

        ## About Amount Fields

        Fields holding amount values are given as a string representing a decimal whole currency amount.

        For example, `"1.23"` in currency `"USD"` would equate to `$1.23`.

        Not all fields will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination.  Intermediate results, such as those that derive from line-level tax calculations, may hold precision up to 8 decimal places.  However, the top-level totals we provide (e.g. `total_amount`) will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination.

        It is up to API consumers to parse the string into a decimal number representation and do any rounding necessary for your application.

        ### Summary

        + If your site **is** using relationship invoicing, you may only use the methods described in this section for working with invoices.

        + If your site is **not** using relationship invoicing, please use the classic invoice methods under the titles of any of the following: 

          + [Invoices](#docTextSection:JYyHXetBrWb9vjMJF)
          + [Invoices: Payments](#docTextSection:AN95FahMs2LLgkico)

        ## Reactivate a subscription

        Chargify offers the ability to reactivate a previously canceled subscription. For details on how the reactivation works, and how to reactivate subscriptions through the application, see [reactivation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/reactivation.html).

        **Please note: The term 
        "resume" is used also during another process in Chargify. This occurs when an on-hold subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**

        + The response returns the subscription object in the `active` or `trialing` state. 
        + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions. 
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        | `include_trial` | Boolean, default `0`. If 1 is sent the reactivated subscription will include a trial if one is available. If `0` is sent, the trial period will be ignored. This parameter should be sent in a query string, and does not need to be nested inside a subscription object |
        | `preserve_balance` | Boolean, default `0`. If `1` is passed, the existing subscription balance will NOT be cleared/reset before adding the additional reactivation charges. |
        | `coupon_code` | The coupon code to be applied during reactivation. |
        | `resume` | Optional. Indicates whether or not Chargify should attempt to resume the subscription's current billing period. Valid values are `true`, `false`, or ` { require_resume: true }`. See [Resuming a subscription](#resuming-a-subscription) for more details.|
        | `resume[forgive_balance]`| Boolean, default `false`. Indicates whether or not Chargify should clear the subscription's _existing_ balance before attempting to resume the subscription. See [Resuming a subscription](#resuming-a-subscription) for more details. |
        | `calendar_billing[reactivation_charge]` | For calendar billing subscriptions only. String, default `prorated`. Determines how to handle the reactivation charge for the subscription, relative to it's snap day. See [Reactivating a calendar billing subscription](#reactivating_a_calendar_billing_subscription]) for more details. |

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then canceled on June 15. 

        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a new billing period.
         
        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ### API parameters for resuming a subscription

        To attempt to resume a subscription, your request must contain the `resume` parameter. Values for this parameter can be:

        * `false`: Do not attempt to resume the subscription, only attempt a reactivation. Note that this is the default behavior of this endpoint in the _absence_ of the `resume` parameter.

        * `true`: Attempt to resume the subscription. If the subscription is not resumable, Chargify will attempt to reactivate the subscription with a new billing period.

        * `{ require_resume: true }`: Attempt to resume the subscription. If the subscription is not resumable, Chargify will _not_ attempt to reactivate the subscription. It will remain in it's current state.

        * `{ forgive_balance: true }`: Indicates whether or not Chargify should clear the subscription's _existing_ balance before attempting to resume the subscription. If subscription cannot be resumed, the balance will remain as it was before the attempt to resume was made.

        Given the above, the body of a JSON request to this endpoint, to resume a subscription, could look like one of the following:
        ```
        {
          resume: true | false
        }

        {
          resume: {
            require_resume: true | false,
            forgive_balance: true | false
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Reactivating a calendar billing subscription

        Subscriptions on calendar billing can be reactivated relative to their snap day.

        Consider a subscription with a snap day of the 15th of the month, which was canceled sometime in the past. You would like to reactivate that subscription on the 10th of the month.  The subscription's initial reactivation period will be from the 10th to the 15th.

        You may choose how to handle the reactivation charge for that subscription by specifying the `calendar_billing[reactivation_charge]`:

        | Reactivation charge | Behavior |
        |---|---|
        | `prorated` | A prorated charge for the product price will be attempted for the period from the 10th to the 15th. |
        | `immediate` | A full-price charge for the product price will be attempted immediately. |
        | `delayed` | A full-price charge for the product price will be attempted at the next renewal, on the 15th. |

        ### API parameters for resuming a subscription

        To specify the reactivation charge, the body of a JSON request to this endpoint, to resume a subscription, should look like:
        ```

        {
          calendar_billing: {
            reactivation_charge: "prorated" | "immediate" | "delayed",
          }
        }
        ```

In addition a new metafield called `language` will have been created. \n\n```\n{\n\t\"subscription\": {\n\t\t\"product_handle\": \"basic\",\n\t\t\"customer_attributes\": {\n\t\t\t\"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n\t\t\t\"last_name\": \"Blow\",\n\t\t\t\"email\": \"joe@example.com\",\n\t\t\t\"zip\": \"02120\",\n\t\t\t\"state\": \"MA\",\n\t\t\t\"reference\": \"XYZ\",\n\t\t\t\"phone\": \"(617) 111 - 0000\",\n\t\t\t\"organization\": \"Acme\",\n\t\t\t\"country\": \"US\",\n\t\t\t\"city\": \"Boston\",\n\t\t\t\"address_2\": null,\n\t\t\t\"address\": \"123 Mass Ave.\",\n\t\t\t\"metafields\": {\n\t\t    \"nickname\": \"Boris\",\n\t\t    \"language\": \"Spanish\"\n\t    }\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"credit_card_attributes\": {\n\t\t\t\"chargify_token\": \"tok_cwhvpfcnbtgkd8nfkzf9dnjn\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n# Passing Payment Information\n\n## Subscription with Chargify.js token\n\nThe `chargify_token` can be obtained using [chargify.js](https://developer.chargify.com/content/chargify-js/chargify-js.html). The token represents payment profile attributes that were provided by the customer in their browser and stored at the payment gateway.\n\nThe `payment_type` attribute may either be `credit_card` or `bank_account`, depending on the type of payment method being added.

        ## 3D Secure - Stripe

        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://help.chargify.com/payment-gateways/testing-3dsecure.html). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response:

        ```
        {
          "errors": [
            "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication."
          ],
          "gateway_payment_id": "pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh",
          "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000 after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.",
          "action_link": "http://acme.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh?one_time_token_id=242"
        }
        ```

        To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`.
        Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information:

        - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
        - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
        - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)
         
        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site. 

        The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`

        ### Example Redirect Flow

        You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:

        1. Create a subscription via API; it requires 3DS
        2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response.
        3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id
        4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to
        5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied
        6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`.
        7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known 
        8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not

        This section describes API endpoints for accessing your site's [MRR Report](https://help.chargify.com/reports/mrr-analytics.html) data.

        ### Understanding MRR movements

        Whenever a subscription event occurs that causes your site's MRR to change (such as a signup or upgrade), we record an MRR movement. These records are accessible via the MRR Movements endpoint.

        Each MRR Movement belongs to a subscription and contains a timestamp, category, and an amount. `line_items` represent the subscription's product configuration at the time of the movement.

        ### Plan & Usage Breakouts

        In the MRR Report UI, we support a setting to [include or exclude](https://help.chargify.com/reports/mrr-analytics.html#displaying-component-based-metered-usage-in-mrr) usage revenue. In the MRR APIs, responses include `plan` and `usage` breakouts.

        Plan includes revenue from:
        * Products
        * Quantity-Based Components
        * On/Off Components

        Usage includes revenue from:
        * Metered Components

        Events-Based Billing is an evolved form of metered billing that is based on data-rich events streamed in real-time from your system to Chargify.

        These events can then be transformed, enriched, or analyzed to form the computed totals of usage charges billed to your customers.

        This API allows you to stream events into the Chargify data ingestion engine.

        Learn more about the feature in general in the [Events-Based Billing help docs](https://help.chargify.com/events/).
