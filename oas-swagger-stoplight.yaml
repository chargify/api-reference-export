        ## Create an Adjustment via API

        Creating an adjustment requires a valid, live subscription. The subscription must be referenced by `id`. For more information on creating a subscription, please see our [Subscriptions Introduction.](#docTextSection:aDNGencbmFC7h2NEW)

        In order to create an adjustment, pass an amount and an optional memo. The amount can be specified by either the `amount` parameter or the `amount_in_cents` parameter. The amount can be specified as a positive or a negative number. 

        Optionally, the `adjustment_method` parameter can be specified.

        ## Create an Adjustment via UI

        For more information on how to record an adjustment via the UI, please see our documentation [here.](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/adjustments.html#how-to-record-an-adjustment)

        ## Scenarios for adjustments

        | Scenario 1 | To create an Adjustment on a Subscription to increase the balance by a certain dollar amount, include the following to your request: | `"amount":"4.00"`                                            |
        |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Scenario 2 | To increase the Subscription balance by a certain amount of cents, use the following attribute in your request:                      | `"amount_in_cents":100`                                      |
        | Scenario 3 | To decrease the Subscription balance by a certain dollar amount, the request must contain:                                           | `"amount":"-4.00"`                                           |
        | Scenario 4 | To decrease the Subscription balance by a certain amount of cents, use:                                                              | `"amount_in_cents":"-400"`                                   |
        | Scenario 5 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact dollar amount, include the following attributes to the request:                          | `"adjustment_method":"target", "amount":"100.00"`            |
        | Scenario 6 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact positive amount of cents, the request must contain the following attributes:             | `"adjustment_method":"target",` `"amount_in_cents":"10000"`  |
        | Scenario 7 | To set the Subscription balance to an exact negative amount of cents, use the following attributes in the request:                   | `"adjustment_method":"target",` `"amount_in_cents":"-10000"` |

      description: |-
        ## Create Allocation for On/Off Component

        For full documentation on configuring allocations for subscriptions, please view the [Allocations](#docTextSection:Fupxh2M7fACmdwsDm) endpoint documentation.

        After a subscription has been created, you may enable of disable the on/off componentat any time. To do this, use the [Allocations](#endpoint:3stsG5oibfdivng9j) endpoint.

        The method creates a new allocation, setting the current allocated quantity for the Component and recording a memo.

        **Notice**: Allocations can only be updated for Quantity and On/Off Components.

        ## Input Fields

        | **Input Fields** | **Description** |
        |----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | quantity |For On/Off components, use `1 `for on and `0` for off. By default, this is an integer.   |
        | memo | (optional) A memo to record along with the allocation |
        | proration_upgrade_scheme | (optional) The scheme used if the proration is an upgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |
        | proration_downgrade_scheme | (optional) The scheme used if the proration is a downgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |
        | payment_collection_method | (optional, default `automatic`) For subscriptions on invoice billing, when `proration_upgrade_scheme` is set to either `prorate-attempt-capture` or `full-price-attempt-capture` and `payment_collection_method` is set to invoice, a mid-period invoice will be created from any charges that are a result of the allocation change. The charge will not appear on the invoice created at the next renewal. For subscriptions on statement billing, this option is ignored. |

        ## On/Off Component Example

        The following example will toggle an on/off component to ON. A value of `0` will toggle the component to OFF.

        ```
        {
          "allocation": {
            "quantity": 5,
            "memo": "Recoding component purchase of Acme Support"

        You can query the API to receive the current quantity for a Quantity Component by sending a GET request.

        ## Querying data via Chargify gem

        You can also query the current quantity via the [official Chargify Gem.]( http://github.com/chargify/chargify_api_ares)

        ```# First way
        component = Chargify::Subscription::Component.find(1, :params => {:subscription_id => 7})
        puts component.allocated_quantity
        # => 23

        # Second way
        component = Chargify::Subscription.find(7).component(1)
        puts component.allocated_quantity
        # => 23

        ## Create Usage for Subscription

        This request will record metered usage for a subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered components, Chargify gives you the option to specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        If an invalid `price_point_id` is submitted, the endpoint will return an error. 

        ## Recording zero usage

        In the event that you would like to record an amount of `0` for a subscriber's component, you must substract the amount from the current usage.

        Example:

        Currently recorded:

        ```{
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "My memo"
          }
        }
        ```

        To record a zero amount, POST the following payload:

        ```{
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "My memo"
          }
        }
        ```

The Product can be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle).\n\nThe `customer_id` is required, unless `customer_reference` or a set of `customer_attributes` is given.\nThe `customer_reference` is required, unless `customer_id` or a set of `customer_attributes` is given.\n\n## Product Handle vs. Product ID\n\nThe `product_handle` is required, unless the `product_id` value is provided instead. The Product ID is not currently published, so we recommend using the API Handle (`product_handle`) instead.\n\n## Calendar Billing\n\nThe `calendar_billing` cannot be used when also specifying `next_billing_at`.\n\n## Taxable Subscriptions\n\nIf your intent is to charge your subscribers tax via [Avalara Taxes](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html) or [Custom Taxes](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/custom-taxes.html), there are a few considerations to be made regarding collecting subscription data. For subscribers to be eligible to be taxed, the following information for the `customer` object or `payment_profile` object must by supplied:\n\n+ A subscription to a [taxable product](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-editing.html#tax-settings)\n+ [Full valid billing or shipping address](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html#full-address-required-for-taxable-subscriptions) to identify the tax locale\n+ The portion of the address that houses the [state information](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html#required-state-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) of either adddress must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2-3 character limit/format.\nThe portion of the address that houses the [country information](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html#required-country-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2 character limit/format.\n\n\n## Existing Customers\n\nAn existing Customer can be specified by `customer_id` (its ID within Chargify) or `customer_reference` (a unique value within your application that you have shared with Chargify). \n\nUse the following JSON example to form an object that will create a subscription for an already existing customer.\n\n```\n    {\n    \t\"subscription\": {\n    \t\t\"product_handle\": \"basic\",\n    \t\t\"customer_id\": 2000,\n    \t\t\"credit_card_attributes\": {\n    \t\t\t\"full_number\": \"1\",\n    \t\t\t\"expiration_month\": \"10\",\n    \t\t\t\"expiration_year\": \"2020\"\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    }\n```\n\n## Existing Customer with Existing Payment Profile\n\n```\n{\n  \"subscription\": {\n    \"product_handle\": \"product-xyz\",\n    \"customer_id\": 17346006,\n    \"payment_profile_id\": 11991557\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## New Customer\n\nA new Customer can be created by providing `customer_attributes`.\n\n## Create Subscription with Coupon\n\nUse the following JSON example to create a subscription with a coupon. This JSON is applicable when a payment method is not required for a product.\n\nFor more information on creating subscriptions with a coupon code, please see the section on creating a subscription with coupon [here.](#endpoint:YFHw4XRYxaqLwGNvk)\n\n```\n      {\n      \t\"subscription\": {\n      \t\t\"product_handle\": \"basic\",\n      \t\t\"customer_attributes\": {\n      \t\t\t\"first_name\": \"Joe\",\n      \t\t\t\"last_name\": \"Blow\",\n      \t\t\t\"email\": \"joe@example.com\"\n      \t\t},\n      \t\t\"credit_card_attributes\": {\n      \t\t\t\"full_number\": \"1\",\n      \t\t\t\"expiration_month\": \"10\",\n      \t\t\t\"expiration_year\": \"2020\"\n      \t\t},\n      \t\t\"coupon_code\": \"SUB111\"\n      \t}\n      }\n```      \n\n## Create Subscription with Coupon and Payment Profile\n\nUse the following JSON example to create a subscription with a coupon.

        | Output Fields | Desscription |
        |----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | component_id | The integer component ID for the allocation. This references a component that you have created in your Product setup |
        | subscription_id | The integer subscription ID for the allocation. This references a unique subscription in your Site |
        | quantity | The allocated quantity set in to effect by the allocation.By default this should be an integer. If decimal allocations are enabled for the component, it will be a decimal number. For On/Off components, use 1 for on and 0 for off. |
        | previous_quantity | The allocated quantity that was in effect before this allocation was created |
        | memo | The memo passed when the allocation was created |
        | proration_upgrade_scheme | The scheme used if the proration was an upgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |
        | proration_downgrade_scheme | The scheme used if the proration was a downgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |
        | timestamp | The time that the allocation was recorded, in [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and UTC timezone, i.e. `2012-11-20T22:00:37Z` |
        | payment | If capture was attempted for a mid-period allocation, includes `amount_in_cents`, `success`, `memo` and `id` attributes describing the payment, or null if no card was on file. |

        ## JSON: Fetch second page (up to 50 more) of allocations

        When updating a price point, it's prices can be updated as well by creating new prices or editing / removing existing ones.

        Passing in a price bracket without an `id` will attempt to create a new price. 

        Including an `id` will update the corresponding price, and including the `_destroy` flag set to true along with the `id` will remove that price.

        ## Bulk Update a Subscription's Component's Price Points

        Updates the price points on one or more of a subscription's components.

        The `price_point` key can take either a:
        1. Price point id (integer)
        2. Price point handle (string)
        3. `"_default"` string, which will reset the price point to the component's current default price point.

        ## Create Metadata

        This method will create a metadata name and populate the metdata field on-the-fly.

        ### Subscription or Customer Resource

        Please pay special attention to the resource  you use when creating metadata.

        ## Finding a Coupon

        You can search for a coupon via the API with the find method. By passing a code parameter, the find will attempt to locate a coupon that matches that code. If no coupon is found, a 404 is returned.

        If you have more than one product family and if the coupon you are trying to find does not belong to the first product family in your site, then you will need to specify (either in the url or as a query string param) the product family id.

        You can retrieve a coupon via the API with the show method. You must identify the coupon in this call by the id parameter that Chargify assigns. If instead you would like to find a coupon using a coupon code, see the Coupon Find method.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/product_families/<product_family_id>/coupons/find.<format>?code=<coupon_code>

        ## Validate a Coupon

        You can verify if a specific coupon code is valid using the `validate` method. This method is useful for validating coupon codes that are entered by a customer. If the coupon is found and is valid, the coupon will be returned with a 200 status code.

        If the coupon is invalid, the status code will be 404 and the response will say why it is invalid. If the coupon is valid, the status code will be 200 and the coupon will be returned. The following reasons for invalidity are supported:

        + Coupon not found
        + Coupon is invalid
        + Coupon expired

        If you have more than one product family and if the coupon you are validating does not belong to the first product family in your site, then you will need to specify (either in the url or as a query string param) the product family id.

        ## Archive a Coupon

        You can archive a Coupon via the API with the archive method.
        Archiving makes that Coupon unavailable for future use, but allows it to remain attached and functional on existing Subscriptions that are using it.
        The `archived_at` date and time will be assigned.

        ## Delete the Coupon Subcode

        If the Coupon subcode is successfully removed, a "200" response code will be returned. Otherwise, a "404" error will be returned.

        ## Example

        Given a coupon with an ID of 567, and a coupon subcode of 20OFF, the URL to `DELETE` this coupon subcode would be: 

        ```
        http://subdomain.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20OFF.<format>
        ```

        Note: If you are using any of the allowed special characters (“%”, “@”, “+”, “-”, “_”, and “.”), you must encode them for use in the URL.

        | Special character | Encoding |
        |-------------------|----------|
        | %                 | %25      |
        | @                 | %40      |
        | +                 | %2B      |
        | –                 | %2D      |
        | _                 | %5F      |
        | .                 | %2E      |

        ## Percent Encoding Example

        Or if the coupon subcode is 20%OFF, the URL to delete this coupon subcode would be: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20%25OFF.<format>

        ## Create a Customer

        You can create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one Customer for a given `reference` value. If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the Customer from your own app, i.e. the Customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given Customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the Customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

        Only those attributes not marked as "read only" may be set via POST (create) or PUT (update) operations.

        ## Required Country Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard Country codes when formatting country attribute of the customer.

        Countries should be formatted as 2 characters. For more information, please see the following wikipedia article on [ISO_3166-1.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes)

        ## Required State Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard State codes when formatting state attribute of the customer.

        + US States (2 characters): [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US)

        + States Outside the US (2-3 characters): To find the correct state codes outside of the US, please go to [ISO_3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) and click on the link in the “ISO 3166-2 codes” column next to country you wish to populate.

        ## Create a Payment Profile

        This method will create a payment profile for the `customer_id` identified in the `payment_profile` object. The `customer_id` is required for creating payment profiles in order to attach it to the proper object.

        You must include a `customer_id` so that Chargify will attach it to the customer entry. If no `customer_id` is included the API will return a `404`.

        ## Create a Payment Profile for ACH usage

        If you would like to create a payment method that is a Bank Account applicable for ACH payments use the following:

        ```
        {
         "payment_profile": {
          "customer_id": [Valid-Customer-ID],
          "bank_name": "Best Bank",
          "bank_routing_number": "021000089",
          "bank_account_number": "111111111111",
          "bank_account_type": "checking",
          "bank_account_holder_type": "business",
          "payment_type": "bank_account"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Active Payment Methods

        **Creating a new payment profile for a Customer via the API will not make that Payment Profile current for any of the Customer’s Subscriptions.**

        ## Activate Payment Profile for a Susbscription

        To activate a new payment profile for a subscription, please see the documentation [here.](#endpoint:cHNDtRXoSo3kj3BHr)

        To make a change, select the Subscription in the Admin UI and choose Payment Details, then click the "Make Active Payment Method" link next to the desired Payment Profile.

        **Note:** Either the `full_number`, `expiration_month`, and `expiration_year` **or** if you have an existing `vault_token` from your gateway, that `vault_token` and the `current_vault` are required.

        The `current_vault` must be one of the following:

        + `bogus` (for testing)
        + `authorizenet`
        + `authorizenet_cim`
        + `beanstream`
        + `bpoint`
        + `braintree_blue`
        + `chargify`.
        + `cybersource`
        + `elavon`
        + `eway`
        + `eway_rapid_std`
        + `firstdata`
        + `fusebox`
        + `litle`
        + `moneris`
        + `moneris_us`
        + `orbital`
        + `payment_express`
        + `paymill`
        + `pin`
        + `quickpay`
        + `square`
        + `stripe_connect`
        + `trust_commerce`
        + `wirecard`

        Passing in the `vault_token` and `current_vault` are only allowed when creating a new payment profile.

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net or Stripe payment gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload. 

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card number data. 

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net** or **Stripe** as their payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net** or **Stripe**, Chargify will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account attributes (like `bank_account_number`), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due subscription after a partial update.

        ## Delete Payment Profile

        This will delete a payment profile belonging to the Customer on the Subscription.

        **Note**: If the Customer has multiple Subscriptions, the payment profile will be removed from all of them.

        **Note**: Please note that if you delete the _default_ payment profile for a subscription, you will need to "specify another payment profile to be the default":#change-default-payment-profile through the api, or either prompt the user to enter a card in the billing portal or on the self-service page, or visit the Payment Details tab on the subscription in the Admin UI and use the "Add New Credit Card" or "Make Active Payment Method" link, (depending on whether there are other cards present).

        Response will be 204 / No content.

        ## Pagination and Filtering

        Using pagination The results can be filtered by date or number.  Traversal is possible using the number filters.

        ## Traversal/Pagination

        Pagination is achieved through the use of the `before_number` or `after_number` filters.  By default, the records are returned in descending `number` order, i.e. newest receipts first.  With each response, a `next` link is provided when there are more results.

        ### Example

        Consider a Site with 1000 Sales Receipts, numbered 1 through 1000.

        #### First Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=981"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 1000,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1000, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 981, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Next Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?before_number=981
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=981",
            "next": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=961"
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 980,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 980, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 961, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Last Request in Traversal

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?before_number=21
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?before_number=21",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 20,
            "count": 20
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 20, ...},
            ... 18 more records ....
            { number: 1, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Subsequent Fetches

        Now that we have ingested "all" of the Sales Receipts for the Site, and we have recorded that our highest `number` was 1000, we can periodically poll to get the new Receipts, always using our new highest number processed:

        ```
        GET /sales_receipts?after_number=1000
        {
          "links": {
            "self": "https://acme.chargify.com/sales_receipts?after_number=1000",
            "next": null
          },
          "meta": {
            "total": 3,
            "count": 3
          },
          "data": [
            { number: 1003, ...},
            { number: 1002, ...},
            { number: 1001, ...}
          ]
        }
        ```

        ## Sorting examples

        Say you would like to get the 10 most recently created statements. You would specify the following optional parameters:

        + sort as `created_at`
        + direction as `desc`
        + limit your `per_page` to `10.

        If you on the other hand wish to find the oldest closed statements you could do:

        + sort as `closed_at`
        + direction as `asc`
      parameters:
        - name: page
          in: query
          description: 'Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The `page` parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to consume the results. You do this by passing in a `page` parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding `?page=2` to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be returned.'

        ## List Statements for a Site

        This method will return a paginated list of all Statements generated by the Subscriptions in your Site.

        Note that this endpoint returns a "lighter" set of the Statement attributes than the "List Statements for a Subscription" endpoint.  This endpoint omits the HTML and textual representations for the Statement: `basic_html_view`, `html_view`, and `text_view`.  If you require these attributes, you can either build them yourself based on the other data returned or fetch a single subscription via the "Read/Show by Chargify ID" endpoint.

        ## Reactivate a Subscription

        Chargify offers the ability to reactivate a previously canceled Subscription. For details on how the reactivation works, and how to reactivate Subscriptions through the Admin Interface, see [Reactivation](https://docs.chargify.com/reactivation).

        + The response returns the Subscription object in the active state. 
        + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for canceled Subscriptions. 
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Optional Parameters

        | include_trial    | Boolean, default `0`. If 1 is sent the reactivated subscription will include a trial if one is available. If `0` is sent, the trial period will be ignored. This parameter should be sent in a query string, and does not need to be nested inside a subscription object |
        |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | preserve_balance | Boolean, default ‘0’. If ‘1’ is passed, the existing subscription balance will NOT be cleared/reset before adding the additional reactivation charges.                                                                                                                   |
        | coupon_code      | The coupon code to be applied during reactivation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ## Reactivating a canceled subscription with an invalid payment profile

        + Given you have a canceled subscription with ID "1000"
        + The subscription has an invalid payment profile
        + Send a PUT request to 
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json`

        The response status should be "422 Unprocessable Entity"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
              {
              "errors": ["The credit card on file could not be charged."]
              }
        ```
         ## Attempting to reactivate an already active subscription
        + Given you have an active subscription with ID "1000"
        + Send a PUT request to 
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json`

        The response status should be "422 Unprocessable Entity"
        + The subscription should be active with the following JSON response

        ```
              {
              "errors": ["Cannot reactivate a subscription that is not marked \"Canceled\", \"Unpaid\", or \"Trial Ended\"."]
              }
         ```
         
        ## Reactivating a canceled subscription while preserving the balance

        + Given you have a product with ID "2002" that costs $19
        + You have a canceled subscription with ID "1000" to a product with ID "2002"
            + 1 charge should exist for $19
            + 1 payment should exist for $19
        + When the subscription has a negative balance of "19"
        A PUT request is sent to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json?preserve_balance=1`

        + Then the response status should be "200 OK"

        And the resulting charges will be: 
        + 2 charges for $19
        + 1 payments should exist for $19
        + The subscription should be active
        + The subscription balance should be zero

        ## Reactivating a canceled subscription with a coupon
        + Given you have a canceled subscription with ID "1000"
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon named "Early Bird"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods
        + The coupon code is "EARLYBIRD"
        + Send a PUT request to 

        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD`

        + The response status should be "200 OK"
        + The subscription should be active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ## Reactivating a canceled subscription with a trial, without the include_trial flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription with ID "1000"
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
        + Send a PUT request to 
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json`
        + The response status should be "200 OK"
        + The subscription should be active
          
        ## Reactivating a canceled subscription with a trial, with the include_trial flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription with ID "1000"
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json?include_trial=1`

        + The response status should be "200 OK"
        + The subscription should be trialing

        ## Reactivating a trial ended subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription with ID "1000"
        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/1000/reactivate.json`

        ## Reset a Subscription Balance

        Chargify offers the ability to easily reset the balance of a Subscription to zero.

        If a Subscription has a positive balance, this API call will issue a credit to the Subscription for the outstanding balance.

        This is particularly helpful if you want to reactivate a canceled Subscription without charging the Customer for their previously owed balance.

        ## Past Due & Unpaid Subscriptions

        If you have a subscription that is in the `past_due` or `unpaid` state, when you reset the balance, the subscription will transition to `active`.

        ## Remove Delayed Cancel
        Removing the delayed cancellation on a subscription will ensure that it doesn't get canceled at the end of the period that it's on. The request will reset the `cancel_at_end_of_period` flag to `false`.

        ## Create a charge

        Creating a charge requires a valid, live subscription. The subscription must be referenced by `subscription_id` (available via the API when subscriptions are read or listed – more).

        A payment in the amount of the assessed charge is automatically captured from the credit card on file for the subscription.

        ## Resume Subscription

        Resume a paused (on-hold) subscription.  If the normal next renewal date has not passed, the subscription will return to active and will renew on that date.  Otherwise, it will behave like a reactivation, setting the billing date to 'now' and charging the subscriber.

        To update a subscription's resume date, use this method to change or update the `automatically_resume_at` date.

        ### Remove the resume date

        ## Create Subscription Preview with Price Points

        This example **does not** use contact information to create a subscription preview. It's optional, bear in mind!

        If you do not use a `price_point_id` then the default price point will be used to calculate the preview amounts.

        ## Create Migration

        In order to create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object when you send a POST request.

        The response will be the updated subscription.

        ## Valid Subscriptions

        Subscriptions can only be in the `active` or `trial` mode in order to be migrated.

        ### Successful – 204 No Content

        On a successful update, a `204` HTTP response is sent along with no body. You can assume the update was successful, and fetch the subscription again if needed.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Connection: keep-alive
        Date: Tue, 03 Nov 2015 21:40:48 GMT
        Status: 204 No Content
        ```

        ### Unpermitted Parameters – 400 Bad Request

        If unpermitted parameters are sent, a `400` HTTP response is sent along with a string giving the reason for the problem, e.g.

        ```
        Unpermitted paramters in request: created_at
        ```

        Note: this will be changing to a JSON or XML response in the near future.

        ## Read Transactions for a Site

        This method will return the full list of transactions for a Site. Pay close attention to filters and pagination in order to control results.

        **Notes about ID/Date Filters**

        - Using `since_id` and/or `max_id` is known as creating an “ID Filter”.

        - Using `since_date` and/or `until_date` is known as creating a “Date Filter”.

        - You may ONLY make use of either an ID Filter or a Date Filter in any one request.

        - If you specify both an ID Filter and a Date Filter, the Date Filter will be ignored.

        **Pagination Notes**

        Stepping through pages of results by incrementing the page number is typically less performant than using an ID Filter with `since_id`, especially at high values of page.
        For example, instead of these successive requests to traverse pagination:

            GET /transactions.json?page=1&per_page=200
            GET /transactions.json?page=2&per_page=200

        It is usually faster to use `since_id` to continue fetching from the last ID you observed:

            GET /transactions.json?since_id=0&per_page=200&direction=asc
            GET /transactions.json?since_id=1567&per_page=200&direction=asc

        In the above example, 1567 is derived by adding 1 to the “last” ID you received from the first request.

            Component price points allows you to charge customers different amounts for the same component. You will be able to define multiple prices and pricing schemes, and then choose which price point to use for each subscription.

            See [Price Points Documentation](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html#price-points) for more information.

            This section describes the API for the new, "Relationship Invoicing" style of invoices introduced in January 2018.

            If you are an existing customer from prior to January 2018 or have not otherwise explicitly opted into this new style of invoices, you are probably looking for the old "Invoices" section that describes Invoice-Billing legacy-style invoices.

            These new invoices provide a single representation of all of your Chargify billing, whether you collect automatically or via remittance.

        ## API Integration

        Chargify can be integrated with many environments and programming languages via our REST API. Some of our users have contributed their API Wrappers in various programming languages. Check out the [API Code Overview](https://developer.chargify.com/content/ecosystem/api-code-samples.html) doc for an introduction to the wrappers and available code samples.

        ## Developer Portal

        We've created a developer-focused portal to give your organization a clear and quick overview of how to integrate with Chargify. 

        The developer portal focuses on a scenarios for integration, plus flow of events. We recommend familiarizing yourself with all of the content in the developer portal, as it's a great compliment to our API documentation.

        Here's a sampling of what's available in the developer portal:

        + [Geting Started Guide for Integrators:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/getting-started/authentication.html) Authentication, Guidelines, Sites/Subdomains
        + [API Basics:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html) Signups, Components, Syncing
        + [Chargify Ecosystem:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/ecosystem/ecosystem.html) Code samples, Signup methods

        ## Chargify Direct

        Our [Chargify Direct documentation](https://developer.chargify.com/content/chargify-direct/chargify-direct.html) can be found under the developer portal. 

        Here you'll find an introduction to how Chargify Direct operates within Chargify. Additionally, we cover some example implementations, as well as troubleshooting.

        ## Testing Guide

        Chargify has compiled a [testing guide](https://help.chargify.com/testing/testing-intro.html) that covers a list of important factors to consider while in the testing phase. Here's a high-level overiew of what's covered in our testing guide:

        + Test credit card basics
        + Test site limits
        + Live mode versus test mode

        We strongly suggest reading over the testing guide, as well as the entire set of application-based documentation to aid in your discovery of the product.

        ## Engage Support

        We always enjoy (and appreciate) hearing about larger integrations ahead of time. If you’re planning on importing a large amount of data into Chargify via our API, we suggest sending a “heads up” to “support@chargify.com” so we can coordinate with you to ensure your import process goes smoothly.

        Our API, while considered stable, is continually being improved and polished. Please feel free to contact support if you experience issues when integrating with the Chargify API.

        ## Support Access

        Access to our Technical Specialist team for API support is currently limited to purchasers of our larger Chargify support plans.

        ## API Guidelines

        Our many merchants all use our API for different purposes. API access is included on all plans at no charge because we believe that you are the owner of your data and you should never feel like your data is ‘locked up’.

        However, because the API means there is little or no user-interaction, it can be very easy to create a program or routine that causes an unnecessarily high burden on our system. Even small accounts can generate huge numbers of expensive API requests by accident.

        In order to maintain a high quality of service for everyone, we ask that you be cautious when implementing your API integration to avoid run-away usage that is disproportionate to the size of your account.

        ## Best Practices

        Here are some tips and best-practices to help keep both your site and ours running smoothly.

        ## Getting Subscription States

        You likely want to check if your customer has an active account, has cancelled, or is behind on his/her payments. The best approach is to keep a local cached copy of the subscription’s state in your own database. You can use [Webhooks](#docTextSection:JYqoZ6JmsZn6gcdYk) to keep up-to-date in near real-time on any changes that occur. This keeps your website up, reduces your coupling to Chargify, and ensures both sites remain as fast as possible.

        Avoid querying Chargify in-line as part of a customer’s request to your site. Doing so could result in:

        + Slowing down your own site while the customer waits for a check to Chargify on every request.
        + If there is a network connectivity issue or in the unlikely event that Chargify is down, your site will also break.
        + As you grow and your customers are more active, you will use up huge numbers of API requests that could result in being blocked because of our automatic abuse prevention.

        ## Synchronizing Your Database

        Normally you should keep your local customer database in sync by using [Webhooks](#docTextSection:JYqoZ6JmsZn6gcdYk). But if you think your database has become out of sync with Chargify, then using the API to check the state of all subscriptions may be the only way to ensure consistency.

        It’s perfectly okay to do this as needed. But it should generally only be relied upon in exceptional circumstances or for periodic reconciliation (usually no more than once a month).

        ## Reporting Usage

        When reporting component usage, avoid sending lots of tiny usage amounts. If you charge by the minute for phone calls, for instance:

        + **Don’t** send in a usage for every minute or every phone call individually.
        + **Don’t** send all usage for all customers all at once. Spread it out or wait a short period of time between each request

        Instead:

        + **Do** send a usage report once a day with how much a customer used for the whole day.

        ## Downloading Bulk Data

        Periodically exporting transaction, subscription, or customer data is a common use case. When possible, we recommend using the built-in [Export](https://help.chargify.com/reports/exporting-data.html) functions inside Chargify to generate reports and download the data. This can often be much faster and can significantly lower your API usage.

        ## About Limits & Blocks

        When doing a large synchronization or retrieving a large amount of data, you may trigger a security failsafe used to prevent abuse and protect our site from attacks.

        We don’t want to block small bursts in usage. So instead of immediately rejecting your requests, we will slow and throttle them. If you see your responses coming in slower, do not parallelize your requests or try to make more concurrent requests to speed things up. You’ll only have to wait longer for your requests to get through.

        If you have too many slowed requests, or your individual account queue gets too full with too many concurrent requests, you’ll likely receive an HTTP “429 Too Many Requests” response code with a message: 

          `Your request was denied due to a usage violation. You can track this request with support by referencing …` 

        with a reference code. Please feel free to [contact support](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can help describe what happened and why the request was blocked.

        If you receive a “429 Too Many Requests” response, your code should be prepared to handle it by pausing its queries, waiting a few minutes, and then proceeding slower (or with less concurrency).

    authentication:
      id: authentication
      name: Authentication
      content: |-
        The API Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS (HTTPS). Your API login credentials are not the same as the credentials you use to log in to the web interface. You must obtain your API credentials separately.

        **Notice**: As of January 2016, you must use TLS >= 1.2 in order to connect to the API. See the TLS [Upgrade Notice](http://help.chargify.com/announcements/tls-upgrade-notice.html) for more information.

        ### Obtaining Your API Credentials

        Your API key can be generated from the “Integrations” tab of your seller dashboard.

        Please see [here](http://help.chargify.com/integrations/api-keys-chargify-direct.html) for more information on obtaining API keys,

        ### Authenticating with your API Credentials

        You will use HTTP Basic Authentication to verify your identity via the API. All requests must come over TLS`/`HTTPS, and be to the subdomain of the Site you wish to access.

        **For example, if your Site’s subdomain is "acme", then you would access the Customer resource at:**
            `https://acme.chargify.com/customers.json`

        **An example using authentication via cURL:**
            `curl -u api-key:x https://subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml`

        **or**
            `curl -i https://<api-key>:x@subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml`

        ### Troubleshooting: Unable to Connect

        If you are unable to connect, the problem is often that you are using an old/unsupported version of SSL or TLS.
        In this case, Chargify will simply drop the connection, and the error message you receive may be cryptic.

        Here are some common error messages that have been reported:

        + The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.
        + `Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.`

        Please, review the information on the [Upgrade Notice](http://help.chargify.com/announcements/tls-upgrade-notice.html) in order to correct the problem.

        ## Notes Intro

        Notes allow you to record information about a particular Subscription in a free text format.

        If you have structured data such as birth date, color, etc., consider using [Metadata instead.](#docTextSection:qYKmxZmb5oEKsvCLk)

        ## Notes Documentation

        Full documentation on how to use Notes in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#notes).

        ## Notes Output Attributes

        The following fields are returned from GET (read) operations:

        | id              | The note’s unique id                                                  |
        |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

        | subscription_id | The id of the related subscription                                    |
        | sticky          | (boolean) Whether or not it is pinned to the top of the list of notes |
        | created_at      | Date and time the note was created                                    |
        | updated_at      | Last update timestamp                                                 |

      content: |-
        When making API requests, it is possible to receive an error even though your request actually completed successfully.

        For example, if you submit an API request and it times out, you can’t be sure whether your request was received by Chargify, or not.

        If you simply re-try the request, you _might_ end up with a duplicate transaction.

        ## Uniqueness Token

        In order to prevent these duplicates, Chargify allows you to supply a `uniqueness_token` parameter in any POST or PUT request.

        The value you supply for the `uniqueness_token` should be long and random, like a UUID. The exact format of the value is up to you.

        If a subsequent request with the same uniqueness_token is received within 60 minutes, it will be rejected with a `409 Conflict` response code and a duplicate error message.

        ## Example

        For example, suppose you are making an adjustment on a subscription. Using curl, you send the following POST request, including a `uniqueness_token`.

        ```json
        curl --verbose -u $CHARGIFY_API_KEY:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -X POST \
        -d @adjustment.json https://$CHARGIFY_SUBDOMAIN.chargify.com/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/adjustments.json

        adjustment.json:
            {"adjustment":
                {
                  "amount": "-12.43",
                  "memo": "Credit for outage on 1/31"
                },
                "uniqueness_token": "2731FB23-98AD-4489-BAF6-7D5CE916F766"
            }
        ```

        After you send your request, there is some problem, and the request times out without a valid response instead of the `201 Created` you were hoping for.

        Since you have supplied a `uniqueness_token`, you can safely re-try the request.

        If you receive the expected `201 Created` (or `422 Unprocessable Entity`) response, you can continue as usual knowing that Chargify never received your first request.

        If you receive a `409 Conflict` and a duplicate error message for the re-try, then you know that the first request was received and processed.

        Example 409 Conflict response:

        ```
            < Status: 409 Conflict
            {"errors":["DuplicatePrevention::DuplicateSubmissionError"]}
            
        ```
        Unfortunately, it is not possible to know what the outcome of the first request was, so you cannot automatically assume it was successful.

        Depending on what type of request you were making, it might be possible to gracefully recover by recording some information about the original request, listening for webhooks, and matching up the webhook payload to find out whether the request succeeded or not.

        In other cases, human intervention will be necessary.

        ## Summary

        We hope this feature will help you prevent duplicate transactions during error handling.

        That said, if you are experiencing repeated timeouts, please [open a support ticket](mailto:support@chargify.com) so we can investigate.

        ## Stats Intro

        The Stats API is a very basic view of some Site-level stats. This API call only answers with JSON responses. An XML version is not provided.

        ## Stats Documentation

        There currently is not a complimentary matching set of documentation that compliments this endpoint. However, each Site's dashboard will reflect the summary of information provided in the Stats reposnse.

        ## Sites Intro

        The “Clear Sites” API is method of allowing merchants to clear customers and subscriptions or all data from a site in TEST mode only.

        ## Sites Documentation

        Full documentation on Sites in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/sites/sites-intro.html).

        Specifically, the [Clearing Site Data](http://help.chargify.com/sites/clearing-site-data.html) section is extremely relevant to this endpoint documentation.

        ## Test Mode Limitations

        **This functionality will only work on sites in TEST mode. Attempts to perform this on sites in “live” mode will result in a response of 403 FORBIDDEN.**

        ## Query String Attributes

        The Chargify API allows you initiate an upgrade/downgrade by posting to either as JSON or XML that potentially includes:

        + `cleanup_scope`: Optional, all or customers, the scope of cleanup of the site to be performed. Default is all.

        ## Cleanup Scope Values

        | Cleanup Scope value | Description                                                                                                                         |
        |---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | ```all```           | Will clear all products, customers, and related subscriptions from the site.                                                        |
        | ```customers```     | Will clear only customers and related subscriptions (leaving the,products untouched) for the site. Revenue will also be reset to 0. |

        ## 403 Response Example

        Method: POST

        In this example, attempting to specify a cleanup_scope that isn’t all or customers will result in a “403 FORBIDDEN”.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/sites/clear_data.json?cleanup_scope=bogus
        ```

        Required Parameter: cleanup_scope

        `Response: 403 FORBIDDEN`

        Result: No change will have been made to the site.

        ## Renewal Preview Intro

        Renewal Preview is an object representing a subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal. 

        ## Inclusion of Components

        This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will return the amount in cents of the products and the components which have been purchased by a subscriber.

        ## Subscription Side Effects

        You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without any side effects. Plain and simple, this will preview data, not log any changes against a subscription.

        ## Renewal Preview Documentation

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation  [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#next-billing).

        ## Adjustments Intro

        Adjustments allow you to change the current balance of a subscription. Adjustments with positive amounts make the balance go up, Adjustments with negative amounts make the balance go down (like Credits).

        ## Adjustments Documentation 

        Full documentation on how to record Adjustments in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/adjustments.html).

        This documentation is focused on how adjustments operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when applying adjustments.

        ## Ajustment Input Attributes

        In order to create an adjustment, you must pass an amount and an optional memo. The amount can be specified by either the `amount` parameter or the `amount_in_cents` parameter. The amount can be specified as a positive or a negative number. Optionally, an `adjustment_method` parameter can be specified.

        | amount            | (either `amount` or `amount_in_cents` is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `10.00` and -$10.00 would be represented as `-10.00`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
        |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents   | (either `amount` or `amount_in_cents` is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `1000` and -$10.00 would be represented as `-1000`. If you pass a value for both `amount` and `amount_in_cents`, the value in `amount_in_cents` will be used and `amount` will be discarded. |
        | memo              | A helpful explanation for the adjustment. This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the assessment of the adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
        | adjustment_method | (Optional) A string that toggles how the adjustment should be applied. If target is passed for this param, the adjustment will automatically set the subscription’s balance to the amount. If left blank, the amount will be added to the current balance.                                                                                                                                                     |

        ## Adjustment Output Attributes

        When an adjustment is successfully created, a representation of the newly created adjustment will be returned to you as JSON or XML in the message body, with the following attributes:

        | success         | Either true or false, depending on the success of the adjustment. (Note: At this time, all adjustments that are returned will return true here. false may be returned in the future when more options are added to the adjustment creation API) |
        |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents | The amount of the adjustment, represented in cents.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
        | memo            | The memo for the created adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

        ## Response Codes

        A response code is returned in the standard HTTP response to your API request.

        | 201                      | Created is returned for the successfully created adjustment.                    |
        |--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | 422 Unprocessable Entity | Returned when the adjustment could not be created (see below section on errors) |
        | 404 Not Found            | Returned if the referenced subscription could not be found.                     |

        ## Errors

        Errors are returned either as an array of error explanation strings and formatted as either an XML or JSON array, depending on your Accept headers. The listing of currently possible error messages is listed below:

        + Memo: cannot be blank.
        + Amount: is not a number.
        + Amount: must be greater than or equal to 0.

        ## Allocations Intro

        Allocations describe a change to the allocated quantity for a particular Component (either Quantity-Based or On/Off) for a particular Subscription.

        Working with this resource, you can:

        + [Create multiple Allocations](#endpoint:JfQwagtttbwDcsh9Q): Change the allocated quantity of multiple components at once

        ## Allocations Documentation

        Full documentation on how to record Allocations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html). 

        This documentation is focused on how allocations operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when recording allocations.

        This documentation also goes into greater detail on how proration is taken into consideration when applying component allocations.


        ## Proration Schemes

        Changing the allocated quantity of a component mid-period can result in either a prorated charge or adjustment being applied to the subscription. When creating an allocation via the API, you can pass the `proration_upgrade_scheme` and the `proration_downgrade_scheme` to be applied.

        For background information on prorated components and upgrade/downgrade schemes, see: API: [Setting Component Allocations.](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html)

        The available `proration_upgrade_scheme` schemes are:

        | Proration Scheme             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      |

        | `prorate-attempt-capture`    | A charge is added and we attempt to charge the credit card on file. If,it fails, the charge will be accrued until the next renewal.                                             |
        | `full-price-delay-capture`   | A charge is added for the full price of the component change, but the card is not charged until the subscription’s next renewal.                                                |
        | `full-price-attempt-capture` | A charge is added for the full price of the component change, and we,attempt to charge the credit card on file. If it fails, the charge will,be accrued until the next renewal. |

        If you need to provide your customer their Management URL through other means, you can retrieve it via the API. Because the URL is cryptographically signed with a timestamp, it is not possible for merchants to generate the URL without requesting it from Chargify.

        In order to prevent abuse & overuse, we ask that you request a new URL only when absolutely necessary. Management URLs are good for 65 days, so you should re-use a previously generated one as much as possible. If you use the URL frequently (such as to display on your website), please **do not** make an API request to Chargify every time.

        ## Billing Portal Documentation

        Full documentation on how the Billing Portal operates within the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/billing-portal/introduction.html).

        This documentation is focused on how the to configure the Billing Portal Settings, as well as Subscriber Interaction and Merchant Management of the Billing Portal. 

        ## Rules for Management Link API

        + When retrieving a management URL, multiple requests for the same customer in a short period will return the **same** URL
        + We will not generate a new URL for 15 days
        + You must cache and remember this URL if you are going to need it again within 15 days
        + Only request a new URL after the `new_link_available_at` date
        + You are limited to 15 requests for the same URL. If you make more than 15 requests before `new_link_available_at`, you will be blocked from further Management URL requests (with a response code `429`)

        ## Charges Intro

        This method of recording a charge against a subscription is referred to as a **"One Time Charge"** in the Chargify Help Documentation.

        For “live” subscriptions (i.e. subscriptions that are not canceled or expired) you have the ability to attach a **one-time-charge** of an arbitrary amount.

        ## Charges Documentation

        Full documentation on how to record a one-time-charge in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/one-time-charges.html).

        ## Charge Input Attributes

        In order to create a charge, you must pass an amount and a memo. The amount can be specified by either the amount parameter or the amount_in_cents parameter.

        | amount                    | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `10.00`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
        |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents           | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `1000`. If you pass a value for both ‘amount’ and ‘amount_in_cents’, the value in ‘amount_in_cents’ will be used and ‘amount’ will be discarded. |
        | memo                      | (required) A helpful explanation for the charge. This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the assessment of the charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
        | use_negative_balance      | (optional) This option specifies whether or not a negative current balance should be used when creating the new charge. If true, use the negative balance on the subscription to calculate the charge. If false, do not use the negative balance. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0 `for `false`.                                       |
        | delay_capture             | (optional) If true, don’t attempt to immediately capture a payment for this charge (instead, wait until the next assessment date). Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`. Note if this option is used use_negative_balance is assumed as false.                                                                                |
        | accrue_on_failure         | (optional) If true, the charge will be added to the subscription whether or not the payment succeeds. If false, only the failed payment will be recorded, and the balance will not be increased. This attribute is ignored if `delay_capture` is true. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`. Defaults to `false`.             |
        | taxable                   | (optional, default `false`) If true, taxes will be assessed on the charge. Acceptable values are `true` or `1` for `true` and `false` or `0` for `false`.  This setting is ignored if the customer tax_exempt flag is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
        | payment_collection_method | (optional, default,`automatic`) For subscriptions on invoice billing, when `delay_capture`: is set to `false`, and `payment_collection_method` is set to `invoice`, a mid-period invoice will be created from this charge. The charge will not appear on the invoice created at the next renewal. For subscriptions on statement billing, this option is ignored.      |

        ## Charge Output Attributes

        When a charge is successfully created, a representation of the newly created charge will be returned to you as JSON or XML in the message body, with the following attributes:

        | success         | Either `true` or `false`, depending on the success of the charge. (Note: At this time, all charges that are returned will return `true` here. `false` may be returned in the future when more options are added to the charge creation API) |
        |-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents | The amount of the charge and captured payment, represented in cents.                                                                                                                                                                        |
        | memo            | The memo for the created charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

        ## Components Intro

        Components are defined and associated with a product family. They become a part of your product offering. These **component definitions** determine what components are named, how they are measured, and how much they cost.

        Components can then be added and “allocated” for each subscription to a product in the product family. These **component line-items** affect how much a subscription will be charged, depending on the current allocations (i.e. 4 IP Addresses, or SSL “enabled”)

        This documentation covers both **component definitions** and **component line-items.** Please understand the difference.

        ## Components Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html). Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources:

        ## Component Definition Input Attributes

        These values should be nested beneath a key that defines the kind of component being created or updated. Valid values are `on_off_component`, `quantity_based_component`, `metered_component`.

        | name              | The name of the Component, suitable for display to customers on statements. i.e. “Text Messages”.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

        | unit_name         | (Not required for On/Off Components) The name of the unit of measurement for the component. It should be singular since it will be automatically pluralized when necessary. i.e. “message”, which may then be shown as “5 messages” on a subscription’s component line-item                         |
        | unit_price        | The amount the customer will be charged per unit when the pricing scheme is “per_unit”. For On/Off Components, this is the amount that the customer will be charged when they turn the component on for the subscription. The price can contain up to 8 decimal places. i.e. 1.00 or 0.0012 or 0.00000065         |
        | pricing_scheme    | (Not required for On/Off Components) The identifier for the pricing scheme. Available options: per_unit, volume, tiered, stairstep.

        ## Component Fractional Pricing

        In May 2011, we added the ability to create components with fractional cent pricing (i.e. $0.0012 per unit). To accommodate this change we made some adjustments on our end that altered how prices are stored. Because of this, we have deprecated the `price_in_cents` field in favor of the `unit_price` field. The `price_in_cents` field is still returned for backwards compatibility, but may not accurately represent the current state of the component if it has been updated since the change. We recommend updating your API calls to use the `unit_price` field as soon as possible.

        ## Subscriptions - Coupons

        In addition to the normal CRUD actions on coupons, you can also create Subscriptions using a Coupon, add a Coupon to an existing Subscription, and validate a Coupon via the API.

        ## Customers Intro

        You may create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one customer for a given reference value. 

        If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the customer from your own app, i.e. the customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

        ## Events Intro

        Chargify Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.

        ## Events Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, "Events" are referred to as "Site Activity".  Full documentation on how to record view Events / Site Activty in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/sites/site-activity.html).

        ## Events Fields and Event Type

        The following fields are returned from GET (read) operations. Note, all events are read only.

        + `id`
        + `key`
        + `message`
        + `subscription_id`
        + `event_specific_data`
        + `created_at`

        The following are different types of events you may see in the `key` field. You can also use these as a method to filter in the query string:

        + `payment_success`
        + `payment_failure`
        + `signup_success`
        + `signup_failure`

        ## Event Specific Data

        Event Specific Data

        Each event type has its own `event_specific_data` specified.

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_product_change` event:

        ```
        {
            "event": {
                "id": 351,
                "key": "subscription_product_change",
                "message": "Product changed on Marky Mark's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
                "subscription_id": 205,
                "event_specific_data": {
                    "new_product_id": 3,
                    "previous_product_id": 2
                },
                "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
            }
        }
        ```

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_state_change` event:

        ```
         {
             "event": {
                 "id": 353,
                 "key": "subscription_state_change",
                 "message": "State changed on Marky Mark's subscription to Pro from trialing to active",
                 "subscription_id": 205,
                 "event_specific_data": {
                     "new_subscription_state": "active",
                     "previous_subscription_state": "trialing"
                 },
                 "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:33-05:00"
             }
         }
        ```
      public: true

        ## Custom Fields: Metadata Intro

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.**

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**


        Chargify Metadata is used to add your own meaningful values to subscription or customer records.
        Metadata is associated to a customer or subscription, and corresponds to a Metafield. When creating a new metadata object for a given record, if the metafield is not present it will be created.

        ## Metadata Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata. 

        Full documentation on how to create Custom Fields in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/custom-fields/custom-fields-intro.html).

        For additional documentation on how to record data within custom fields, please see our subscription-based documentation [here.](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#custom-fields)

        ## Metadata versus Metafields

        Metadata is the information that populates the metafield.

        ## Metadata limits

        Metadata values are limited to 2kB in size. Additonally, there are limits on the number of unique “names” available per resource. See [Metafields documentation](#docTextSection:BDXuRKX5n8K4T6Jsh).

        ## Server Response

        The following fields are returned from GET (read) operations.

        | name        | The name of the attribute that is added to the resource.  |
        |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | value       | The value of the attribute that was added to the resource |
        | resource_id | The resource id that the metadata belongs to              |

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.**

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**

        Chargify Metafields are used to add meaningful attributes to subscription and customer resources.

        Metafield are the place where you will set up your resource to accept additional data. It is scoped to the site instead of a specific customer or subscription. Think of it as the key, and Metadata as the value on every record.

        ## Metafields Documentation

        Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata.

        ## Metafields vs Metadata 

        Metadata is the information that populates the metafield.

        ## Metafields "On-the-Fly"

        It is possible to create Metafields “on the fly” when you create your Metadata – if a non-existant name is passed when creating Metadata, a Metafield for that key will be automatically created. The Metafield API, however, gives you more control over your “keys”.

        ## Metafield Limitations

        Each site is limited to 200 unique Metafields (i.e. keys, or names) per-resource.

        ## Metafields Scope

        The scope field has four acceptable attributes, which dictate where metafields will appear:

        + hosted
        + csv
        + invoices
        + statements
         
        + If configured in the Admin UI or via the API be careful sending updates to metafields with the scope attribute – if a partial update is sent it will overwrite the current configuration.

        ## Hosted Metafields

        The `hosted` field is an array of products which specifies which hosted pages that the metafield will appear on.
        Supports a special value of “all” if you would like the field to be present on all hosted pages.

        ```“hosted”: [“1”, “2”]```

        ## CSV Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude in csv exports.

        ```“csv”: “1”```

        ## Statement Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude in statments.

        ```“statements”: “1”```

        ### Invoice Metafields

        Values of ```1``` (include) or ```0``` (exclude) can be used to include or exclude on invoices.

        ```“invoices”: “1”```

        ## Server Respones

        The following fields are returned from GET operations.

        | name       | The name of the attribute that is added to the resource.      |
        |------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
        | scope      | This specifies where the metafield / metadata will visible    |
        | data_count | The number of metadata that are associated to this metafield. |

        ## Migrations Intro

        Chargify offers the ability to upgrade or downgrade a Customer’s subscription in the middle of a billing period, which is called a “Migration”. 

        ## Migrations Documentation

        Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/upgrades-downgrades.html).

        ## Migration vs. product change

        If you want a migration with proration, then you want to continue with the methods listed below. However, if you just want to change the product the customer is subscribed to (with no proration) then you’ll just want to update the [subscription product.](#endpoint:4D8tKPkKC3So5X6qs)

        ## Input Attributes

        The Chargify API allows you initiate an upgrade/downgrade by posting JSON or XML that includes:

        | product_id or product_handle | The ID or handle of the `target` Product. A Subscription can be migrated to another product for both the current Product Family and another Product Family. **Note: Going to another Product Family, components will not be migrated as well.** |
        |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | include_trial                | Boolean, default `0`. If `1` is sent the customer will migrate to the new product with a trial if one is available. If `0` is sent, the trial period will be ignored.                                                                           |
        | include_initial_charge       | Boolean, default 0. If 1 is sent initial charges will be assessed. If 0 is sent initial charges will be ignored.                                                                                                                                |
        | include_coupons              | Boolean, default `1`. If `1` (or nothing) is sent, any coupons associated with the subscription will be applied to the migration. If `0` is sent, coupons will not be applied.                                                                  |

        ## Failed Migrations

        One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a subscription to it's current product. Please be aware of this issue!

        ## Components: Metered Usage Intro

        The Chargify API allows you to record metered component usage by posting JSON or XML that includes:

        + `quantity`: The amount of units used
        + `memo`: An optional description of the usage

        When you record metered usage, you are simply create a new request to add "usage" to the subscription for that particular component.

        Metered usage is cumulative and charges for components are assessed on the `next_billing_date` of the subscription. Another way of stating this is: metered usage is tallied and charged at the end of the subscriber's current recurring period.

        ## Recording Multiple Usage Limitations

        As of the time of this publication there is not a method to record multiple usage of a metered component against a subscription.

        ## Metered Components versus Quantity-based Components

        Metered components allow you to record "usage" of a component, such as text messages. These types of components reset to 0 at the beginning of each billing period.

        On the other hand, for quantity-based components, you would record an allocation. Quantity-based components do not reset every month. They will charge the same quantity of components one billing period to the next.

        ## Metered Components Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html). Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources:

        ## Payments Intro

        Chargify allows you to record payments that occur **outside** of the normal flow of payment processing.
        These payments are considered **external payments**. A common case to apply such a payment is when a customer pays by check or some other means for their subscription.

        Payment Profiles house the credit card, ACH (Authorize.Net or Stripe only,) or PayPal (Braintree only,) data for a customer. The payment information is attached to the customer within Chargify, as opposed to the Subscription itself.


        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html#taxes)

        ## Components: Quantity Allocations Intro

        The “Allocated Quantity” may be set for the Quantity Component on specific subscriptions via the API at the time the subscription is created, or at any time thereafter.

        Full documentation on how to record Allocations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html). 

        This documentation is focused on how allocations operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when recording allocations.

        This documentation also goes into greater detail on how proration is taken into consideration when applying component allocations.

        ## Quantity-based Components Versus Metered-based components

        Quantity-based components allow you to record allocation/purchase of an add-on resource or component. Quantity-based components do not reset every month. They will charge the same quantity of components one billing period to the next.

        Metered components allow you to record "usage" of a component, such as text messages. These types of components reset to 0 at the beginning of each billing period.

        ## Quantity-based Components Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-components.html). Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources:

        + [Recording Quantity-based Component Usage](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/setting-component-allocations.html#reporting-quantity-based-allocations)
        + [Recording component usage against a subscription](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#components-line-items)

        ## Proration Upgrade Schemes

        Each time you record an allocation, it's important to focus on the proration scheme type.

        If you do not specify a proration scheme, the default scheme for the Site will be used. This setting is accessable in-app via Settings-->Components

        | Proration Scheme             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      |

        ## Refund Input Attributes

        In order to create a refund, you must pass an a payment id, amount and a memo. The amount can be specified by either the amount parameter or the amount_in_cents parameter.

        | payment_id      | (required) The id of the Payment that the credit will be applied to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
        |-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount          | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `10.00`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
        | amount_in_cents | (either ‘amount’ or ‘amount_in_cents’ is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer. For example, $10.00 would be represented as `1000`. If you pass a value for both ‘amount’ and ‘amount_in_cents’, the value in ‘amount_in_cents’ will be used and ‘amount’ will be discarded. |
        | memo            | (required) A helpful explanation for the refund. This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
        ## Refund Output Attributes

        When a refund is successfully created, a representation of the newly created refund will be returned to you as JSON or XML in the message body, with the following attributes:

        | id              | The id of the created refund                                         |

        ## Refunds - External Intro

        Use this endpoint to record refunds done outside of Chargify, such as directly at the gateway or by sending a check to the subscriber.

        | amount          | The amount represented as a string with two decimal places, for example 14.50.                               |
        |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | amount_in_cents | The amount represented as a string in cents. For example if the refund was for $14.50, you would pass `1450` |
        | memo            | A description of why the refund occured                                                                      |

        Note that external refunds will reduce revenue, but they do not affect the balance due for the subscription.

        ## Refunds Documentation

        Full documentation on how to apply a refund in the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/refunds.html).

        ## External Refunds versus Refunds

        It's important to note that 2 types of refunds can be created via the API. 

        + [Refunds](#docTextSection:PdfZnp5bXtPjCr7Qg) interact with the Merchant's gateway and return funds directly to the Subscriber's bank.
        + External refunds log a refund against the Subscriber's entry in Chargify. No funds are returned to the subscriber's bank account. 

        ## External Refund Use Case
         
        The use case for this type of refund is as follows:

        + You have a gateway that does not do **direct** refunds back to a Subscribers's bank account
        + To process a refund, you process the refund **through** your gateway account.
        + Afterwards, record the refund within Chargify

        ## Statements Intro

        Chargify Statements give you and your customers a breakdown of Subscription charges, payments, credits, and activity on a period-by-period basis. A Statement is similar to an “Invoice” because it is marked as currently paid or unpaid. Statements display all account activity for a specific usage period.

        ## Statements Documentation

        Documentation for Statements in the Chargify UI can be accessed via the following links / topics:

        + [Statements Reference](http://help.chargify.com/statements/statements-intro.html)
        + [Viewing Statements](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#statements)
        + [Statement Settings](http://help.chargify.com/settings/statements.html)

        ## Statement Presentation

        The Statements API offers three ways to easily render a statement on your site. You can include a text representation of the statement or one of two HTML views that can be styled to your liking.

        | text_view       | A text representation of the statement             |
        |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
        | basic_html_view | A simple HTML representation of the statement      |
        | html_view       | A more robust HTML representation of the statement |

        Rendering individual statements can also be done as PDF by using the Accept/Content-Type header application/pdf or appending .pdf as the `<format>` portion of the URL.

        ## Statement Output Attributes

        All of the statement attribute fields are returned from GET (read) operations. Note, all of these attributes are read only.

        ## Subscriptions Intro

        Full documentation on how Subscriptions operate within Chargify can be located under the following topics:

        + [Subscriptions Reference](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-intro.html)
        + [Subscriptions Actions](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-actions.html)
        + [Subscription Cancellation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/cancellation.html)
        + [Subscription Reactivation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/reactivation.html)
        + [Subscription Import](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html)

        ## Subscription Input Attributes

        When creating a subscription, you must specify a product and a customer. Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the Product being subscribed ([see Product Options](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-options.html)).

        The product may be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle).

        An existing customer may be specified by a `customer_id` (ID within Chargify) or a `customer_reference` (unique value within your app that you have shared with Chargify via the reference attribute on a customer). A new customer may be created by providing `customer_attributes`.

        | product_handle     | The API Handle of the product for which you are creating a subscription. Required, unless a `product_id` is given instead.                                        |
        |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | product_id         | The Product ID of the product for which you are creating a subscription. The product ID is not currently published, so we recommend using the API Handle instead. |
        | customer_id        | The ID of an existing customer within Chargify. Required, unless a `customer_reference` or a set of `customer_attributes` is given.                               |
        | customer_reference | The reference value (provided by your app) of an existing customer within Chargify. Required, unless a `customer_id` or a set of `customer_attributes` is given.  |

        | cancellation_message                  | (Optional) Can be used when canceling a subscription (via the HTTP DELETE method) to make a note about the reason for cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
        |---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | cancellation_method                   | (Optional) Can be used when canceling a subscription (via the HTTP DELETE method) to make a note about how the subscription was canceled. |
        | reason_code                           | (Optional) Can be used when canceling a subscription (via the HTTP DELETE method) to indicate why a subscription was canceled. |
        | next_billing_at                       | (Optional) Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on “Date/Time Format” in our [subscriptions import documentation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html). If you provide a next_billing_at timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription. In fact, no payment will be captured at all. The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by `next_billing_at`. If you do not provide a value for `next_billing_at`, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created. See further notes in the section on Importing Subscriptions. |
        | expires_at                            | Timestamp giving the expiration date of this subscription (if any).

        | expiration_tracks_next_billing_change | (Optional, default false) When set to `true`, and when next_billing_at is present, if the subscription expires, the expires_at will be shifted by the same amount of time as the difference between the old and new “next billing” dates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

        ## Subscription Preview

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a subscription by POSTing the same JSON or XML as for a subscription creation.

        ## Subscription Preview Documentation

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation  [here](http://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscription-summary.html#next-billing).

        ## Input Attributes

        A Subscription Preview is an object representing a proposed subscription’s initial assessment and first renewal, including discounts and taxes. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged if they complete their signup.

        For full information, please see our API documentation on how to [Create a Subscription](#endpoint:uw4BjXCFjTzSYYSaA).

        A `subscription_preview` object with a `current_billing_manifest` and a `next_billing_manifest` containing the following fields:

        | start_date                | The timestamp for the beginning of the period covered by the manifest                                                             |
        |---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | end_date                  | The timestamp for the end of the period covered by the manifest                                                                   |
        | period_type               | The type of billing period: recurring for previews                                                                                |
        | existing_balance_in_cents | An integer representing the amount of the subscription’s current balance. Will be zero since the subscription does not yet exist. |
        | subtotal_in_cents         | An integer representing the amount of the total pre-tax, pre-discount charges that would be assessed                              |
        | total_discount_in_cents   | An integer representing the amount of the coupon discounts that would be applied                                                  |
        | total_tax_in_cents        | An integer representing the total tax charges that would be assessed                                                              |
        | total_in_cents            | An integer representing the total amount owed, less any discounts, that would be assessed                                         |
        | line_items                | An array of objects representing the individual transactions that would be created for this subscription                          |

        ## Side effects

        A subscription will not be created by sending a POST to this endpoint. It is meant to serve as a prediction.

        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        This endpoint will preview taxes applicable to a purchase. In order for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must be met:

        + Taxes must be configured on the subscription
        + The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or component, or combination of the two.
        + The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping address in order to calculate tax

        For more information about creating taxable previews, please see our documentation guide on how to create [taxable subscriptions.](https://help.chargify.com/taxes/avalara-managed-sales-tax.html#creating-taxable-subscriptions)

        ## Non-taxable Subscriptions

        If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax, please feel free to leave off the billing information.

        ## Subscription Override Intro

        This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that are usually managed for you automatically. Some of the fields can be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be set using this endpoint.

        This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Chargify data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before you started using Chargify. For example, you may choose to import your historical subscription data, and would like the activation and cancellation dates in Chargify to match your existing historical dates. Chargify does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API.

        Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create and update endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually managed by Chargify, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your own.**

        ## Subscriptions Override Documentation

        There is no current complimentary documentation for this endpoint. 

        ## Fields That Can Be Manipulated

        | activated_at         | Can be used to record an external signup date. Chargify uses this field to record when a subscription first goes active (either at signup or at trial end)                |
        |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | canceled_at          | Can be used to record an external cancellation date. Chargify sets this field automatically when a subscription is canceled, whether by request or via dunning.           |
        | cancellation_message | Can be used to record a reason for the original cancellation.                                                                                                             |
        | expires_at           | Can be used to record an external expiration date. Chargify sets this field automatically when a subscription expires (ceases billing) after a prescribed amount of time. |
        No other fields are currently available. Attempting to set any other fields will cause a `400 Bad Request` response. You only need to send the fields you would like to change.

        Note that changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription.

        The fields should be nested beneath a `subscription` key – see the examples below for more information.

        ## Headers

        + `Accept`: set to either `application/json` or `application/xml` depending on the top of response you desire
        + `Content-Type`: set to either `application/json` or `application/xml` depending on the top of request body you send

        ## Subscriptions Import Intro

        Subscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the following scenarios:

        + You already have existing subscriptions with specific renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify
        + You already have credit cards stored in your provider’s vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens

        Before importing, you should have already set up your products to match your offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes.

        ## Subscriptions Import Documentation

        Full documentation on how import Subscriptions using the **import tool** in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html).

        ## Adding components during import

        Components may also be included in the import. See [Product Components](#docTextSection:EseRiQJY4GMtnkfyR) for more information.

        ## Subscription Input Attributes

        The following _additions_ to the subscription input attributes make imports possible.

        | next_billing_at | Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on “Date/Time Format” in our [subscriptions import documentation](https://help.chargify.com/subscriptions/subscriptions-import.html). If you provide a next_billing_at timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription. In fact, no payment will be captured at all. The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by next_billing_at. If you do not provide a value for next_billing_at, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created. |

        ## Payment Profile Attributes

        + `payment_profile_attributes`

        | vault_token          | the “token” provided by your vault storage for an already stored payment profile                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
        |----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | customer_vault_token | (only for Authorize.Net CIM storage): the customerProfileId for the owner of the customerPaymentProfileId provided as the vault_token                                                                                                                                                    |
        | current_vault        | the vault that stores the payment profile with the provided vault_token. May be `authorizenet`, `trust_commerce`, `payment_express`, `beanstream`, `braintree_blue` (see additional notes on Braintree Blue, below), `quickpay`, `eway`, `eway_rapid_std`, `stripe_connect`, or `wirecard`               |
        | last_four            | (optional): If you have the last 4 digits of the credit card number, you may supply them here so that we may create a masked card number (i.e. ‘XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234’) for display in the UI                                                                                              |
        | card_type            | (optional): If you know thecard type (i.e. Visa, MC, etc) you may supply it here so that we may display the card type in the UI. May be `visa`, `master`, `discover`, `american_express`, `diners_club`, `jcb`, `switch`, `solo`, `dankort`, `maestro`, `forbrugsforeningen`, or `laser` |

        ## Payment Profile Attributes vs Credit Card Attributes

        `payment_profile_attributes` are the same thing as `credit_card_attributes` used elsewhere in the documentation. The two keys are interchangeable, pick one to use but not both. Most new documentation will refer to `payment_profile_attributes` 

        ## Current Vault

        If you are using a Legacy gateway such as "eWAY Rapid (Legacy)" or "Stripe (Legacy)" then please contact Support for further instructions on subscription imports.

        ## Braintree Blue (Braintree v2) Imports

        Braintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway, please provide the `vault_token` parameter with the value from Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the “Payment Profile Token”. At this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree Blue gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree Customer.

        When importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type` to `paypal_account`.

        ## Webhooks During Import

        If no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal. If you do set a future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the webhooks are fired when the subscription is created. Keep reading for more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which scenarios.

        ### Successful creation with Billing Date

        Scenario: If `next_billing_at` provided

        + `signup_success`
        + `billing_date_change`

        ### Successful creation without Billing Date

        Scenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided

        + `signup_success`
        + `payment_success`

        ### Unsuccessful creation

        Scenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided

        + signup_failure

        ### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached:

        + `renewal_success or renewal_failure`
        + `payment_success or payment_failure`

        ### Date and Time Formats

        We will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of next_billing_at in to a date or time. For best results, use a known format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC 2822 or ISO 8601 .

        The following are all equivalent and will work as input to `next_billing_at`:

        ```
          Aug 06 2020 11:34:00 -0400 2010
          Aug 06 2020 11:34 -0400 2010

          2010-08-06T15:34:00Z
        ```
        You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be noon

        ## API Overview

        The Chargify API allows you to interact with our system programmatically from your own application. Using the API you interact with Resources such as:

        - Products
        - Subscriptions
        - Customers
        - etc.

        The API attempts to conform to the [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) design principles.
        You interact with the resources exposed via the API by accessing resource collection and element URIs using the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
        Chargify accepts and returns both JSON and XML data via the API.

        You’ll likely need access to a web developer or programmer (if you’re not one) to get the most use out of the API.

        ## Available Formats: JSON and XML

        JSON is the primary and recommended format for use with the Chargify API.  XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for Merchants who require it.

        ## Authentication

        Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS >= 1.2 (HTTPS), as described in [API Authentication](https://developer.chargify.com/content/getting-started/authentication.html)

        ## URL

        The URL for API requests includes the subdomain of the Site you are working with:

        `https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/<resource URI>`

        ## Response Data

        Response data is sent as either XML or JSON, depending on the type of data requested (`HTTP Content-Type` header) or the type specified as being accepted (HTTP `Accept` header).

        GETs for individual statements & invoices may also be requested as PDF using `application/pdf` or appending `.pdf` to the resource URI.

        Response codes are sent via the normal HTTP Response Code, and are documented separately for each resource.

        For boolean fields, please note that a value of `null` should be considered as false.

        ## Response Time Zones

        API responses from Chargify are sent with the timezone of current Chargify site. 

        Alternately, webhooks sent from Chargify globally utilize EST as the timezone for all content in the body of the payload. 

        ## Request Data

        POST and PUT request data may be formatted as either XML (`application/xml`) or JSON (`application/json`). For best results, you should set your HTTP `Content-Type` request header accordingly, although you may also specify your format by appending `.xml` or `.json` extensions on to the resource URI.

        Note that Chargify does not accept PUT or POST data sent as query params or form encoded data – data must be sent as either XML or JSON. If you fail to set your `Content-Type` to either `application/xml` or `application/json`, your request may fail due to triggering of forgery protection mechanisms.

        ## Debugging

        If you’re having difficulty executing a request via our API, try the simplest thing and attempt your request via the curl command-line tool, as shown in the below example. Add the `--verbose` flag to your request to receive even more debugging information.

        Another handy tool is [RequestBin](http://requestb.in/). You could create a RequestBin and send your request to them instead of us to see visually what it is you’re sending, if you’re not sure.

        If you are unable to connect at all, check that you are using TLS 1.2 or better, and review the information in [API Authentication Troubleshooting.](#docTextSection:xnGtyxFy5nLWhGB34)

        ## Backwards Compatibility

        We consider the following changes to be backwards compatible and may make them without advance notice:

        + Adding new API endpoints, or adding new attributes in the responses of existing endpoints
        + Adding new optional parameters to be sent to existing API endpoints
        + Adding new fields to exported data
        + Changing the type or length of any of the ID attributes
          + For example, most IDs are currently integers, but you should not assume that this will always be the case.

        In addition, you should not depend on the order of attributes within the API response as this may change.

        ## Examples

        The following examples use the curl command-line tool to exectute API requests.

        ## Webhooks Intro

        The Webhooks API allows you to view a list of all webhooks and to selectively resend individual or groups of webhooks.

        ## Webhooks Documentation

        Full documentation on how to use webhooks within the Chargify UI can be located [here](http://help.chargify.com/webhooks/introduction.html).

        ## Webhook Attributes

        + `id` The unique identifier for the webhooks (unique across all of Chargify). This is not changed on a retry/replay of the same webhook, so it may be used to avoid duplicate action for the same event.
        + `successful` A boolean flag describing whether the webhook was accepted by the webhook endpoint for the most recent attempt. (Acceptance is defined by receiving a “200 OK” HTTP response within a reasonable timeframe, i.e. 15 seconds)
        + `event` A string describing which event type produced the given Webhook
        + `body` The data sent within the Webhook post
        + `signature` The calculated Webhook signature
        + `signature_hmac_sha_256` The calculated HMAC-SHA-256 Webhook signature
        + `created_at` Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was created
        + `accepted_at` Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was accepted by the merchant endpoint. When a webhook is explicitly replayed by the merchant, this value will be cleared until it is accepted again.
        + `last_sent_at` Timestamp indicating when the most recent attempt was made to send the Webhook
        + `last_error_at` Timestamp indicating when the last non-acceptance occurred. If a webhooks is later resent and accepted, this field will be cleared.
        + `last_sent_url` The url that the endpoint was last sent to.
        + `last_error` Text describing the status code and/or error from the last failed attempt to send the Webhook. When a webhook is retried and accepted, this field will be cleared.

      content: |-
        ## Coupon Subcodes Intro

        Coupon Subcodes allow you to create a set of unique codes that allow you to expand the use of one coupon.

        For example:

        Master Coupon Code: 

        + SPRING2020

        Coupon Subcodes: 

        + SPRING90210
        + DP80302
        + SPRINGBALTIMORE

        Coupon subcodes can be administered in the Admin Interface or via the API.

        When creating a coupon subcode, you must specify a coupon to attach it to using the coupon_id. Valid coupon subcodes are all capital letters, contain only letters and numbers, and do not have any spaces. Lowercase letters will be capitalized before the subcode is created.

        ## Coupon Subcodes Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create coupon subcodes in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://help.chargify.com/products/product-coupons.html#coupon-codes).

        ## ReasonCodes Intro

        ReasonCodes are a way to gain a high level view of why your customers are cancelling the subcription to your product or service.

        Add a set of churn reason codes to be displayed in-app and/or the Chargify Billing Portal. As your subscribers decide to cancel their subscription, learn why they decided to cancel. 

        ## ReasonCode Documentation

        Full documentation on how Reason Codes operate within Chargify can be located under the following links.

        ## Components: On/Off Toggling

        The Chargify API allows you to toggle an on/off component by posting JSON or XML. This is helpful in the case where the subscription has already been created. By this method, you are recording the usage of this on/off component against the subscription.

        ## Proration Schemes

        Each time you record an allocation, it's important to focus on the proration scheme type.

        If you do not specify a proration scheme, the default scheme for the Site will be used. This setting is accessable in-app via Settings-->Components

        ## Component Line-Item Input Attributes

        The attributes listed in the following sections should be nested under the `component` key, e.g. the following JSON could be used to update the `allocated_quantity` on a Component Line-Item:

        ```
          {
            "component": {
              "allocated_quantity": 23
            }
          }
        ```

        ### Inputs for Quantity-Based Line-Items

        + `allocated_quantity` The current allocation for the component on the given subscription.

        For more, see also [API: Quantity Component Allocations](#docTextSection:ySykKNKfEXRJ5CgTK).

        ### Inputs for On/Off Line-Items

        + `allocated_quantity` Use `1` for on and `0` for off.

        ### Inputs for Metered Line-Items

        The Metered Component usages for a subscription are managed through the [Metered Usage API](#docTextSection:Qw7A6cxbCxbSkZrnM)

        ## Component Line-Item Output Attributes

        All component line-item kinds share the following attributes:

        + `subscription_id`
        + `component_id`
        + `name`
        + `unit_name`
